For more background, feel free to store this in a separate file somewhere for future counseling and such:
I actually completed CS50 before I started these learning updates. Along with a simple Google Cloud Certification that was a few hours long, and passing both CompTIA A+ exams.
For undergrad, I went into Biology and ended with a 3.96. I was trying to be a good kid and pursuing the safety and guarantee of becoming a doctor. My GPA actually dropped to 3.96 due to a semester full of Fs I got after lashing out (burn out caused me to leave mid semester, and during that time I recall going to my uni's computer science building and asking to sit in on a lecture. They were designing Frogger. I was exceptionally envious and sad in that moment).

I then scored a 522 / top 1% on my MCAT the year after graduation, and got accepted to medical school in San Antonio. After a few years I failed out, due to burnout and lack of interest. I had moments of extremely low self-esteem and lack of self-worth which inspired me to take a MENSA IQ test to kinda prove to myself I'm still worth something. I got in, which helped a bit I suppose, but it was a silly thing to do in hindsight.

Last year I began my current work journey, and have been trying to make up for lost time it feels like.
