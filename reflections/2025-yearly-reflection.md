# 2025 Year in Review

2025 was my first full year in this new field: IT. I've started to gear myself more towards an "AI Engineer" and picked up a few certifications.
I also went to Iran and got married at the end of the year, carrying over a bit into 2026. My goal is to be near her as soon as possible.

I hope that my application for her to join me here gets processed quickly... but I'm not sure how realistic that is. Perhaps I'll have to move.
No idea.

Still looking to grow, and will likely not be at DHR at the end of 2026 (likely much sooner).

2025... you were ok I suppose. 2026 is already better though haha.

Still not diamond in league, but that's become much less of a priority very quickly with my life starting to move forward.

## Key Insights

**What Worked**: Rapid skill acquisition, systems thinking maturity, stepping up during leadership gaps, recognizing burnout patterns early

**Warning Signs**: Unsustainable pace (9+ concurrent projects in December), "making up for lost time" syndrome, using work as escape mechanism, external validation seeking

**Critical Realization**: Problem isn't capability—it's sustainability. Need permission to do LESS, not encouragement to do MORE.

**Year Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Exceptional growth, but sustainability remains critical concern)  
**Completed**: January 29, 2026
