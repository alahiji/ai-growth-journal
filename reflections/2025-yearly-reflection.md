# 2025 Year in Review

2025 was a year of exceptional professional growth and major life changes. I transitioned from DHR intern to Associate AI Automation Engineer, delivered 18+ production projects in 4 months, earned two professional certifications, and got married—all while recognizing I'm repeating the same burnout pattern that broke me in undergrad and med school.

The difference this time is awareness. I started therapy, created this journal, and for the first time in my adult life, I'm making choices that are actually mine. The question for 2026 isn't "how much can I achieve?" It's "how can I build a life worth living?"

## Key Insights

**What Worked**: Rapid skill acquisition, systems thinking maturity, stepping up during leadership gaps, recognizing burnout patterns early

**Warning Signs**: Unsustainable pace (9+ concurrent projects in December), "making up for lost time" syndrome, using work as escape mechanism, external validation seeking

**Critical Realization**: Problem isn't capability—it's sustainability. Need permission to do LESS, not encouragement to do MORE.
