## Personal Growth Notes

This month was mostly about personal life rather than professional development. Spent 3 weeks in Iran, which was important for my relationship (long-distance with my girlfriend). 

Now in the last few days of January trying to catch up and get back into the swing of things. The transition back to work after extended travel is harder than expected - feeling the pressure to catch up quickly while also dealing with the usual work stress.

**Key Reflections:**
- Travel and personal relationships are important, but the re-entry to work life is challenging
- Need to find better balance between personal life and career development
- The Azure cert from December is a good foundation, but need to actually apply it
- Currently feeling the pressure of "catching up" which may be unrealistic expectation

**Focus Areas for This Month:**
- Traveled in Iran (3 weeks)
- Minimal professional development
- Earned Azure AI cert (late December, carrying into this month's achievements)
- Now focusing on catching up and re-establishing routine
