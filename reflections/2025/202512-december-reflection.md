- [x] Advanced ORBIT scaling and location/bin integration - Confidence level (8/10)

### Projects Completed
1. **365 Manager Project** - Went live! Presented in front of Server Team and helpdesk. Major milestone for inventory management.
2. **Nursing Units Design & Reporting** - Designed nursing units, added comprehensive reporting, and created bundle functionality.
3. **ORBIT Scaling Initiative** - Scaled ORBIT to other locations, required recreating locations and bins table for better Infor integration.
4. **MISSION CONTROL Launch** - Set up .NET service listener to receive ADTs via TCP, launched MISSIONCTRL dashboard for real-time monitoring.
5. **FHIR Application** - Began creating FHIR application, completed setup and capability statement generation.
6. **Infor Email Extraction** - Built new applicant extraction program for automated processing.
7. **Replenishment File System** - Extensive debugging and tracking improvements for inventory replenishment.
8. **Missing Items Reporting** - Implemented comprehensive missing items reporting system.
9. **Hyperlink File Fix** - Created Python script to resolve hyperlink issues.

### Skills Developed
- **Technical Skills**: Azure AI services, .NET TCP listeners, FHIR capability statements, Python automation scripts, advanced SQL reporting, Infor integration patterns, real-time dashboard development
- **Soft Skills**: Presentation skills (Server Team/helpdesk), stakeholder communication, project coordination across multiple initiatives
- **Tools/Frameworks**: Azure AI-102 services, .NET Core, FHIR APIs, Python scripting, ORBIT platform

## Challenges & Solutions

### Biggest Challenge
Managing an exceptionally high volume of concurrent projects (9+ major initiatives) while preparing for AI-102 certification and maintaining quality across all deliverables.

### How You Overcame It
- Prioritized based on immediate business impact (365 Manager, MISSION CONTROL)
- Conducted extensive ORBIT testing to ensure stability during scaling
- Presented workflow to Kevin/Lee for ORBIT error catching to ensure team alignment
- Leveraged Python automation to solve recurring issues (hyperlink fixes)
- Maintained focus on certification study despite heavy workload

### Lessons Learned
- Presenting to technical teams (Server Team/helpdesk) requires different preparation than user-facing demos
- Scaling systems (ORBIT) often requires fundamental architecture changes (locations/bins table redesign)
- Real-time monitoring systems (MISSION CONTROL) provide immediate value and visibility
- Balancing certification study with production work is challenging but achievable with discipline
- Multiple concurrent projects require clear prioritization and stakeholder communication

## Achievements & Milestones
- [x] **AI-102 Certification Achieved (2025-12-28)** - Major professional milestone
- [x] 365 Manager project went live with successful presentation
- [x] MISSION CONTROL dashboard launched
- [x] ORBIT scaled to multiple locations
- [x] FHIR application setup completed
- [x] Delivered 9+ major projects/features in one month

## Knowledge Gaps Identified
- [ ] Advanced .NET service patterns for healthcare messaging - Priority: Medium
- [ ] FHIR resource validation and error handling - Priority: Medium
- [ ] Scaling strategies for multi-location systems - Priority: Low (addressed through ORBIT work)

## Goals for Next Month (January 2026)

### Learning Goals
- [ ] Apply AI-102 knowledge to practical projects - Target: 2026-01-31
- [ ] Deep dive into FHIR resource types and workflows - Target: 2026-01-15

### Project Goals
- [ ] Continue MISSION CONTROL enhancements
- [ ] Expand FHIR application capabilities
- [ ] Monitor 365 Manager post-launch performance
- [ ] Plan Iran trip (3 weeks)

### Skill Goals
- [ ] Improve .NET service architecture knowledge
- [ ] Strengthen presentation and demo skills
- [ ] Continue gym routine consistency

## Resources to Explore
- [ ] Azure AI practical implementation guides
- [ ] Advanced FHIR workflows and use cases
- [ ] .NET microservices patterns for healthcare

## Personal Growth Notes

This was an incredibly productive but intense month. Delivered 9+ major projects while also achieving AI-102 certification on 12/28. The 365 Manager presentation to Server Team/helpdesk was a confidence builder—presenting technical work to technical audiences is different from user demos.

The ORBIT scaling work was particularly satisfying because it required fundamental rethinking of our architecture (locations/bins table redesign) rather than just adding features. This kind of systems thinking is becoming more natural.

MISSION CONTROL launch represents a shift toward real-time monitoring and observability, which feels like the right direction for our infrastructure.

**Warning signs**: The volume of concurrent projects this month was at the upper limit of sustainable. While everything got delivered, the pace was exhausting. Need to be mindful of burnout patterns from past (undergrad, med school). The AI-102 cert is a great achievement.

**Positive patterns**: Successfully balanced certification study with production work. Presentation skills improving. Architecture thinking maturing (ORBIT redesign). Building systems that provide ongoing value (MISSION CONTROL, FHIR foundation).

**Focus Areas for This Month:**
- Delivered 9+ major projects/features
- Achieved AI-102 certification (12/28)
- Scaled ORBIT to multiple locations
- Launched MISSION CONTROL real-time monitoring
- Presented to Server Team/helpdesk successfully
- Maintained quality across all deliverables despite high volume
