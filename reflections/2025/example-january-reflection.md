# Monthly Reflection - January 2025

## Date Range
From: 2025-01-01  
To: 2025-01-31

## Learning Summary

### New Concepts Mastered
- [ ] Neural Networks Fundamentals - Confidence level (4)
- [ ] Pandas Data Manipulation - Confidence level (3)
- [ ] Git Version Control - Confidence level (4)

### Projects Completed
1. **MNIST Digit Classifier** - Built first neural network, learned about overfitting and regularization
2. **Data Analysis Dashboard** - Created interactive visualizations with Plotly, improved data cleaning skills

### Skills Developed
- **Technical Skills**: TensorFlow/Keras basics, advanced Pandas operations, Jupyter notebook workflows
- **Soft Skills**: Better at breaking down complex problems, improved documentation habits
- **Tools/Frameworks**: Git, Docker basics, VS Code extensions for Python

## Challenges & Solutions

### Biggest Challenge
Understanding backpropagation algorithm and how gradients flow through the network layers.

### How You Overcame It
Watched multiple YouTube videos, implemented a simple network from scratch in NumPy, and drew out the mathematical computations step by step.

### Lessons Learned
Visual learning works best for me. Need to implement concepts from scratch to truly understand them, not just use high-level APIs.

## Achievements & Milestones
- [x] Completed first neural network project
- [x] Set up proper development environment
- [x] Started maintaining this learning journal
- [ ] Contributed to open source project (moved to next month)

## Knowledge Gaps Identified
- [ ] Deep understanding of different optimizers - Priority level (High)
- [ ] Computer vision techniques beyond basic CNNs - Priority level (Medium)
- [ ] MLOps and model deployment - Priority level (Medium)

## Goals for Next Month

### Learning Goals
- [ ] Master Convolutional Neural Networks - Target completion date: 2025-02-15
- [ ] Complete Fast.ai course Part 1 - Target completion date: 2025-02-28
- [ ] Learn Docker for ML projects - Target completion date: 2025-02-20

### Project Goals
- [ ] Start computer vision project (image classification)
- [ ] Complete Kaggle competition entry
- [ ] Improve MNIST project with better architecture

### Skill Goals
- [ ] Practice PyTorch (currently only know TensorFlow)
- [ ] Learn Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- [ ] Get comfortable with cloud computing (AWS/Colab Pro)

## Resources to Explore
- [ ] Fast.ai Practical Deep Learning course
- [ ] "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet
- [ ] CS231n Stanford course videos
- [ ] PyTorch official tutorials

## Personal Growth Notes
Really enjoying the hands-on aspect of AI/ML. The combination of math, programming, and real-world applications is exactly what I was looking for. Need to be more consistent with daily practice - some days I get distracted by other things. Planning to set aside 2 hours every morning for focused learning.

The community aspect is also important - joined the Fast.ai forum and local ML meetup group. Getting different perspectives helps a lot.
