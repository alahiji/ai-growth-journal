From: 2025-11-01  
To: 2025-11-30

## Previous Month Summary
**Previous Month (October 2025)**: Practiced 4 new concepts including SQL conditional formatting, Python modularization, data pipelines, and HL7 messaging. Completed 3 projects including major app refactoring. Achieved 6 milestones. Overall rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Thanksgiving break was great!)

## Learning Summary

### New Concepts Mastered
- [x] FHIR messaging standards and healthcare interoperability - Confidence level (6/10)
- [x] Infor IPA workflow automation for OR scheduling hand-offs - Confidence level (7/10)

### Projects Completed
1. **OR Staff Implementation & Bugfix Sprint** - Shadowed the OR team during their first real-world use, logged defects in real time, and shipped same-day fixes that stabilized their workflows.
2. **Mission Control Kickoff (11/24)** - Ran discovery with stakeholders, mapped telemetry requirements, and drafted the initial architecture for the new Mission Control initiative.
3. **Leadership Transition Support** - Absorbed DHR CIO responsibilities after David’s departure by coordinating roadmap reviews, status updates, and decision logs for the team.

### Skills Developed
- **Technical Skills**: Real-time production debugging, FHIR/HL7 validation, Infor IPA approvals, Mission Control telemetry design, automated regression patching.
- **Soft Skills**: Cross-functional leadership, rapid stakeholder alignment, mentoring, expectation-setting during leadership transitions.
- **Tools/Frameworks**: Infor IPA designer, Mission Control dashboards (Power BI + internal telemetry stack), Jira triage automations.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Biggest Challenge
Balancing a live OR rollout with the sudden leadership vacuum created by David’s departure.

### How You Overcame It
Created a daily OR triage board, paired with staff during change-of-shift huddles, and delegated platform upkeep to teammates so I could both unblock the field and steer leadership discussions.

### Lessons Learned
Being onsite with end users exposes tiny workflow gaps that never appear in specs. Leadership during transitions isn’t about grand plans—it’s about providing calm, transparent decision-making so everyone keeps moving.

## Achievements & Milestones
- [x] Completed FHIR Fundamentals Certification (2025-11-18)
- [x] Set up Mission Control database

## Knowledge Gaps Identified
- [x] FHIR hl7 messages - Priority level (High) - ADDRESSED with FHIR Fundamentals Cert
- [x] Basic compsci terms - Priority level (Medium)
- [ ] Advanced Infor IPA design patterns (error handling, reprocessing) - Priority level (Low)

## Goals for Next Month

### Learning Goals
- [ ] Complete Azure AI-102 Cert - Target completion date: 2025-12-14

## Personal Growth Notes
Working with OR staff is eye opening. Seeing what they need and trying to tailor our app for them. Seeing the app malfunction during their first real-world use was eye opening. 

**Focus Areas for This Month:**
- Managing increased workload with David's departure- David's back as a contractor already!
- Keeping OR staff confident through rapid bug triage and updates
- Laying foundations for Mission Control deliverables
- Still haven't started Luigi AI
