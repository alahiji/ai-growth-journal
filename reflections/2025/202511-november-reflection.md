## Challenges & Solutions

### Biggest Challenge
Balancing a live OR rollout with the sudden leadership vacuum created by David’s departure.

Working with OR staff is eye opening. Seeing what they need and trying to tailor our app for them. Seeing the app malfunction during their first real-world use was eye opening. 

**Focus Areas for This Month:**
- Managing increased workload with David's departure- David's back as a contractor already!
- Keeping OR staff confident through rapid bug triage and updates
- Laying foundations for Mission Control deliverables
- Still haven't started Luigi AI
