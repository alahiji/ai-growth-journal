## Running Themes
<!-- Update as patterns emerge across sessions -->
- **Work relationship:** Feels unprepared; school success didn't translate to work skills
- **Time burden:** 10hr total (work + commute + lunch)
- **Emotional state:** Exhausted; occasional thoughts of self-harm (passive, no intent to act)
- **Coping attempts:** Self-help books (not working)
- **Core fear:** The *effort*—fear of having to push this hard indefinitely
- **Career history:** Tried medicine (didn't work out due to workload + loneliness + lack of passion), now IT/computer work in a hospital
- **Pattern:** Working in hospital = daily reminder of path not taken
- **Relationship:** **MARRIED** (late Dec 2025/early Jan 2026); long-distance; source of support but not enough to offset work misery
- **Relationship fears:** Love won't be enough; wife will be disappointed in life with him; guilt about her sacrifices (family, environment)
- **Original dream:** Graphic designer (first genuine spark in conversation)
- **Structure vs content:** Commute + long hours may be as unbearable as the work itself
- **Worldview:** Currently dark—"not worth having kids" = symptom of pain, not philosophy
- **Values:** Doesn't need altruism to feel fulfilled; donates money as contribution
- **Sleep:** Currently 7 hours (11pm-6am), oversleeps on weekends; likely insufficient for stress level
- **Career desires:** Wants more challenging/creative work; questioning if feasible in IT
- **Future plans:** Considering GCC country move to be closer to wife's family and speed up reunification

## Goals & Progress
<!-- Track therapeutic goals as they're established -->
1. *To be established in future sessions*

---

## Important Context
<!-- Session-specific context only. See /_SHARED_CONTEXT.md for full timeline and patterns -->

### Quick Reference (Full details in Shared Context)
- **Age 28**, married (Jan 2026), long-distance with Saba
- **Trauma history**: Parents imprisoned age 15/16, sent to Iran, returned alone before 18
- **Career pattern**: Biology → Med school (failed out) → IT (current)
- **Burnout cycle**: Third time emerging (undergrad, med school, now)
- **Current job**: Associate AI Automation Engineer at DHR, top 20% performer
- **Key pattern**: High achievement in fields not aligned with genuine interests

### Session-Specific Observations
- **"Good day" description** (Session 2): Working from home, near family, autonomy - work is incidental, proximity matters
- **Gaming**: 22-36 hrs/week League/TFT (avoidance symptom, not root problem)
- **Work philosophy**: Would retire if could; seeking autonomy/creativity/meaning, not "no work"
- **Core insight**: Problem is structure (commute, office, separation) not work content

---

## Current Therapy Homework (Session 4)

1. **Have the remote work conversation at DHR.** Specific ask: remote status + possibility of working from Dubai. Don't leave it vague.

2. **Journal on the loneliness.** Not career, not Saba — just the 11 years. What has it cost you? What did you build around it to cope?

3. **Write about your parents' divorce.** What happened, what you witnessed, what it taught you. Then: in what ways is Saba like your mother? In what ways is she different?

4. **Don't bring up the prenup with Saba again** until more internal work is done here.

### Previous Homework (Session 3)
1. ~~Have the FIRE conversation with Saba~~ → Partially done; cultural mismatch surfaced
2. Journal: letter to 22-year-old self in medical school
3. Identify one thing that's yours
4. ~~Continue DHR salary conversation~~ → Now in CEO-level discussions, remote work next

## Notes for Next Session

### Key Insights from Session 2
- **"Good day" reveals**: Problem is structure (commute, office), not work itself
- **Gaming as symptom**: 22-36 hrs/week filling void, avoiding life that doesn't feel worth being present for
- **What client actually wants**: Proximity > productivity, work as background, autonomy, connection, guilt-free rest
- **Current life is opposite**: Separated from Saba, work draining, no autonomy, alone, guilty rest

### Core Question Posed
**What if you can't have both?** High-paying career that drains you vs. simpler job that lets you be near family with energy for life?
- Client would choose life
- Afraid to admit it (feels like giving up)
- **Reframe**: Choosing life you want isn't giving up—it's first time choosing for yourself

### Themes to Continue Exploring
- Remote work as solution (same work, different structure)
- What's being avoided through gaming
- Internal vs. external motivation (still proving something?)
- Relationship between proximity and happiness
- Redefining "success" from external to internal metrics
- **NEW: Pattern of softening/qualifying honest statements** (didn't mention 40%, softened Saba concern)
- **NEW: Saba as "reason for living"** — codependency risk, need for independent identity/purpose
- **NEW: FIRE communication with Saba** — vision vs. mechanics, potential values mismatch or framing issue
- **NEW: Reactive job searching** — "applying everywhere" may be scatter pattern, not strategy
- **NEW: Medical school regret / grass-is-greener backward** — romanticizing the path not taken, same logic that led to medicine
- **NEW: Iranian cultural expectations** — breadwinner model vs. FIRE; Saba may lack framework for early retirement concept
- **NEW: Avoidance pattern deepening** — didn't mention 40%, softens statements, scared to talk to Saba about FIRE. Rooted in childhood survival strategy (mother's ultimatum)
- **NEW: No independent purpose** — "I'd be looking for a Saba" = dependency, not foundation. Has never chosen something purely for himself
- **NEW: 11 years of loneliness** — left Iran at 17, alone since 2015; loneliness is the constant underneath burnout, gaming, urgency around Saba
- **NEW: Prenup/money fear** — rooted in parents' divorce; projecting betrayal onto Saba who hasn't earned that suspicion; already married so prenup ship has sailed
- **NEW: Self-protection armor** — 11 years of building walls; now getting in the way of intimacy he actually wants; already bracing for Saba to leave
- **NEW: Career momentum** — CEO-level AI discussions, centralized AI portal, insurance claims; most promising career development so far
