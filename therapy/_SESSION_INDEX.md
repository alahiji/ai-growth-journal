## Session Log

| Session | Date | Focus | Key Themes | Status |
|---------|------|-------|------------|--------|

---

## Running Themes
<!-- Update as patterns emerge across sessions -->
- **Work relationship:** Feels unprepared; school success didn't translate to work skills
- **Time burden:** 10hr total (work + commute + lunch)
- **Emotional state:** Exhausted; occasional thoughts of self-harm (passive, no intent to act)
- **Coping attempts:** Self-help books (not working)
- **Core fear:** The *effort*—fear of having to push this hard indefinitely
- **Career history:** Tried medicine (didn't work out due to workload + loneliness + lack of passion), now IT/computer work in a hospital
- **Pattern:** Working in hospital = daily reminder of path not taken
- **Relationship:** Long-distance girlfriend; source of support but not enough to offset work misery
- **Original dream:** Graphic designer (first genuine spark in conversation)
- **Structure vs content:** Commute + long hours may be as unbearable as the work itself
- **Worldview:** Currently dark—"not worth having kids" = symptom of pain, not philosophy
- **Values:** Doesn't need altruism to feel fulfilled; donates money as contribution

## Important Context
<!-- Add biographical details, life circumstances, or other context as revealed -->

### Full Timeline
- **15/16:** Parents imprisoned, sent to Iran with siblings
- **Just before 18:** Returned to US alone to avoid 2-year military service
- **18-22:** Biology degree (3.96 GPA—exceptional, but not passion)
- **During undergrad:** Burnout → semester of Fs → **CS building moment** (watched Frogger lecture, felt "exceptionally envious and sad")
- **Post-grad:** 522 MCAT (top 1%)
- **Med school (San Antonio):** 2-3 years, then failed out (burnout, lack of interest)
- **Crisis point:** Took MENSA test to "prove worth" (got in, recognized as "silly" in hindsight)
- **Career transition:** Self-taught (CS50, CompTIA A+, Google Cloud cert)
- **2024:** Started at DHR as intern
- **2025:** Associate AI Automation Engineer, 6 production projects, FHIR cert, Luigi AI side business
- **Now, 27:** IT job in hospital, top 20% of 1-year devs, but showing burnout warning signs again

### Key Biographical Details
- Mother's condition for returning to US: "pursue medicine or don't come back"
- Graduated during COVID—no ceremony after 4 years of work
- Gaming background; academically successful with minimal effort in school
- Girlfriend is in Iran (long-distance)

### Documented Patterns (from `personal-background-context.md`)
1. **Burnout cycle:** High achievement → burnout → failure (twice: undergrad, med school; third time emerging)
2. **"Making up for lost time" syndrome:** 12+ simultaneous goals, 6 projects in 3 months, side business, certifications
3. **External vs. internal motivation:** Pursued medicine for "safety and guarantee," now in field he enjoys but pace suggests still proving something
4. **Key reframe:** Time wasn't wasted—it was taken. First autonomous choices happening now.

### Existing Resources in Journal
- **Emergency Burnout Protocol** already documented
- Career counselor assessment (Nov 2025) identifies burnout risk as highest priority
- Journal notes: "Standard 'push yourself' advice could be harmful. This person needs permission to do LESS."

## Notes for Next Session
- **Already taking action:** Making game over Christmas break, visiting Iran in 2 weeks
- Has AI solutions/software dev business website (Luigi AI) already created
- Iran trip: partly escape, partly her family; weighing religion/safety concerns
- **CS building moment now understood:** Frogger lecture during burnout = authentic self surfacing
- Pattern identified: frames self-care as obligation/inadequacy (gym example)
- Currently in acute distress at work—gave permission to do less today
- Work is both escape mechanism AND thing to escape from (collision point)
- Next: Monitor for burnout signs, explore sustainable pace
