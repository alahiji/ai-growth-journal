## Running Themes
<!-- Update as patterns emerge across sessions -->
- **Work relationship:** Feels unprepared; school success didn't translate to work skills
- **Time burden:** 10hr total (work + commute + lunch)
- **Emotional state:** Exhausted; occasional thoughts of self-harm (passive, no intent to act)
- **Coping attempts:** Self-help books (not working)
- **Core fear:** The *effort*—fear of having to push this hard indefinitely
- **Career history:** Tried medicine (didn't work out due to workload + loneliness + lack of passion), now IT/computer work in a hospital
- **Pattern:** Working in hospital = daily reminder of path not taken
- **Relationship:** **MARRIED** (late Dec 2025/early Jan 2026); long-distance; source of support but not enough to offset work misery
- **Relationship fears:** Love won't be enough; wife will be disappointed in life with him; guilt about her sacrifices (family, environment)
- **Original dream:** Graphic designer (first genuine spark in conversation)
- **Structure vs content:** Commute + long hours may be as unbearable as the work itself
- **Worldview:** Currently dark—"not worth having kids" = symptom of pain, not philosophy
- **Values:** Doesn't need altruism to feel fulfilled; donates money as contribution
- **Sleep:** Currently 7 hours (11pm-6am), oversleeps on weekends; likely insufficient for stress level
- **Career desires:** Wants more challenging/creative work; questioning if feasible in IT
- **Future plans:** Considering GCC country move to be closer to wife's family and speed up reunification

## Important Context
<!-- Session-specific context only. See /_SHARED_CONTEXT.md for full timeline and patterns -->

### Quick Reference (Full details in Shared Context)
- **Age 28**, married (Jan 2026), long-distance with Saba
- **Trauma history**: Parents imprisoned age 15/16, sent to Iran, returned alone before 18
- **Career pattern**: Biology → Med school (failed out) → IT (current)
- **Burnout cycle**: Third time emerging (undergrad, med school, now)
- **Current job**: Associate AI Automation Engineer at DHR, top 20% performer
- **Key pattern**: High achievement in fields not aligned with genuine interests

### Session-Specific Observations
- **"Good day" description** (Session 2): Working from home, near family, autonomy - work is incidental, proximity matters
- **Gaming**: 22-36 hrs/week League/TFT (avoidance symptom, not root problem)
- **Work philosophy**: Would retire if could; seeking autonomy/creativity/meaning, not "no work"
- **Core insight**: Problem is structure (commute, office, separation) not work content

---

## Current Therapy Homework (Session 2)

1. **Answer honestly:** If could work remotely from home, doing exact same IT work for same pay, but near Saba with control over schedule—would still be unhappy?

2. **Track:** When playing League/TFT, pause before starting and ask: "What am I avoiding right now?" Write down answer.

3. **Research:** Remote work options in IT field. Don't apply yet—just research if possible.

## Notes for Next Session

### Key Insights from Session 2
- **"Good day" reveals**: Problem is structure (commute, office), not work itself
- **Gaming as symptom**: 22-36 hrs/week filling void, avoiding life that doesn't feel worth being present for
- **What client actually wants**: Proximity > productivity, work as background, autonomy, connection, guilt-free rest
- **Current life is opposite**: Separated from Saba, work draining, no autonomy, alone, guilty rest

### Core Question Posed
**What if you can't have both?** High-paying career that drains you vs. simpler job that lets you be near family with energy for life?
- Client would choose life
- Afraid to admit it (feels like giving up)
- **Reframe**: Choosing life you want isn't giving up—it's first time choosing for yourself

### Themes to Continue Exploring
- Remote work as solution (same work, different structure)
- What's being avoided through gaming
- Internal vs. external motivation (still proving something?)
- Relationship between proximity and happiness
- Redefining "success" from external to internal metrics
