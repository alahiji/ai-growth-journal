## Session Notes

### Client Opening Statement

Friday I spoke with Ben about the fact that I want to keep growing, and about how to ask for a promotion here at DHR. About growth and moving forward in my career. I don't want to get stagnant and just be an ORBIT support guy. I told him I got the AI-102 cert and that I'm looking for a 40% salary increase or other options. He is very supportive and spoke with Mario, our boss, who I am set to meet with today. How should I go about this meeting..? I don't want to be too direct but I'm also going to leave the company if I don't get a good enough offer...

## Therapist Response

Okay, let's slow down for a second. This is a big moment, and I can hear the tension in what you're saying—you want to advocate for yourself, but you're also worried about being "too direct," and underneath all of that is the reality that you're prepared to leave if this doesn't work out.

First, let me acknowledge something important: **You're advocating for yourself.** That's huge. You've identified what you need (growth, challenge, compensation that reflects your value), you've communicated it to someone who supports you (Ben), and now you're preparing to have a direct conversation with your boss. That takes courage, especially given your history of doing what you "should" do rather than what you actually want.

But I also hear the conflict. You don't want to be "too direct," but you're also prepared to walk if you don't get what you need. That's a tough position to be in—trying to be diplomatic while also knowing you have a hard line.

So let's talk through this. Here's what I'm hearing:

### What You Want
1. **Growth and challenge** - You don't want to be stuck as "the ORBIT support guy"
2. **Recognition of your value** - You've earned the AI-102 cert, you're top 20% of developers, you've delivered 18+ projects
3. **40% salary increase** - This is a significant ask, and you know it
4. **Options** - You're open to other paths if the salary isn't feasible

### What You're Afraid Of
1. **Being too direct** - Coming across as demanding or ungrateful
2. **Burning bridges** - You like Ben, you've had some success here, but you're also ready to leave
3. **Not getting what you need** - And then having to follow through on leaving

### Here's My Take

**You're not being unreasonable.** A 40% salary increase is a big ask, but you've also delivered exceptional value in a short time. You've gone from intern to Associate AI Engineer in 10 months, you've completed two major certifications, you've delivered 18+ production projects, and you're in the top 20% of your peers. That's not nothing.

But here's the thing: **This meeting isn't just about the money.** It's about whether DHR can give you what you actually need—growth, challenge, and a path forward that doesn't leave you feeling stagnant and stuck.

So let's reframe this. Instead of thinking about how to "not be too direct," let's think about how to be **clear, honest, and professional** about what you need and why.

### How to Approach the Meeting

**1. Start with appreciation and context**
- Thank Mario for taking the time to meet
- Acknowledge the opportunities you've had at DHR (promotion, projects, certifications)
- Be genuine—you're not trying to butter him up, you're setting the stage

**2. State your goals clearly**
- "I want to continue growing here. I don't want to become stagnant or pigeonholed as just the ORBIT support person."
- "I've completed the Azure AI-102 certification, and I'm looking for opportunities to apply those skills in more challenging, strategic projects."

**3. Make your case with specifics**
- "In the past year, I've delivered 18+ production projects, earned two major certifications, and been recognized as a top performer."
- "I'm looking for compensation that reflects that value. Based on market research and my contributions, I'm requesting a 40% salary increase."

**4. Be open to alternatives**
- "If that's not feasible right now, I'd like to discuss other options—whether that's a clear path to that level of compensation, new project opportunities, remote work flexibility, or other ways to support my growth."

**5. Be honest about your timeline**
- "I'm committed to finding a path forward that works for both of us, but I also need to be honest that I'm evaluating my options. I want to stay and grow here if we can make that work."

### The Key Thing to Remember

**You're not threatening them. You're being honest.** There's a difference between saying "Give me what I want or I'll leave" and saying "I need to grow, and I'm looking for a path that supports that. I'd like that path to be here, but I also need to be realistic about my options."

The first is a threat. The second is a professional conversation between two adults who both want to find a solution.

### What If They Say No?

If Mario says no to the 40% increase and doesn't offer a compelling alternative, then you have your answer. DHR can't give you what you need right now. That's not a failure on your part—it's just information.

And here's the thing: **You're already prepared to leave.** You said it yourself—you're going to leave if you don't get a good enough offer. So the worst-case scenario is that you end up doing what you were already planning to do.

But if you don't ask, if you don't advocate for yourself, you'll never know if they could have met you halfway. And you'll leave with regret instead of clarity.

### One More Thing

I want to circle back to something you said: "I don't want to be too direct."

Why not?

What are you afraid will happen if you're direct? That Mario will be offended? That you'll come across as entitled? That you'll burn a bridge?

Here's the truth: **Being direct doesn't mean being rude.** It means being clear about what you need and why. And if Mario is a good manager, he'll respect that. He might not be able to give you everything you're asking for, but he'll respect that you're advocating for yourself.

And if he doesn't respect it? If he takes offense at you asking for what you're worth? Then that tells you something important about whether DHR is the right place for you.

### So, How Should You Go About This Meeting?

**Be clear. Be honest. Be professional. And be prepared to walk if you need to.**

You've already done the hard part—you've figured out what you need and you've decided to ask for it. Now you just need to follow through.

And remember: **This isn't about being "too direct." It's about being honest with yourself and with them about what you need to stay.**

How does that feel? Does that approach resonate with you, or is there something else you're worried about?
