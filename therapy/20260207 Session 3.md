## Session Notes

### Client Opening Statement

Friday I spoke with Ben about the fact that I want to keep growing, and about how to ask for a promotion here at DHR. About growth and moving forward in my career. I don't want to get stagnant and just be an ORBIT support guy. I told him I got the AI-102 cert and that I'm looking for a 40% salary increase or other options. He is very supportive and spoke with Mario, our boss, who I am set to meet with today. How should I go about this meeting..? I don't want to be too direct but I'm also going to leave the company if I don't get a good enough offer...

---

## Therapist Response

Okay, let's slow down for a second. This is a big moment, and I can hear the tension in what you're saying—you want to advocate for yourself, but you're also worried about being "too direct," and underneath all of that is the reality that you're prepared to leave if this doesn't work out.

First, let me acknowledge something important: **You're advocating for yourself.** That's huge. You've identified what you need (growth, challenge, compensation that reflects your value), you've communicated it to someone who supports you (Ben), and now you're preparing to have a direct conversation with your boss. That takes courage, especially given your history of doing what you "should" do rather than what you actually want.

But I also hear the conflict. You don't want to be "too direct," but you're also prepared to walk if you don't get what you need. That's a tough position to be in—trying to be diplomatic while also knowing you have a hard line.

So let's talk through this. Here's what I'm hearing:

### What You Want
1. **Growth and challenge** - You don't want to be stuck as "the ORBIT support guy"
2. **Recognition of your value** - You've earned the AI-102 cert, you're top 20% of developers, you've delivered 18+ projects
3. **40% salary increase** - This is a significant ask, and you know it
4. **Options** - You're open to other paths if the salary isn't feasible

### What You're Afraid Of
1. **Being too direct** - Coming across as demanding or ungrateful
2. **Burning bridges** - You like Ben, you've had some success here, but you're also ready to leave
3. **Not getting what you need** - And then having to follow through on leaving

### Here's My Take

**You're not being unreasonable.** A 40% salary increase is a big ask, but you've also delivered exceptional value in a short time. You've gone from intern to Associate AI Engineer in 10 months, you've completed two major certifications, you've delivered 18+ production projects, and you're in the top 20% of your peers. That's not nothing.

But here's the thing: **This meeting isn't just about the money.** It's about whether DHR can give you what you actually need—growth, challenge, and a path forward that doesn't leave you feeling stagnant and stuck.

So let's reframe this. Instead of thinking about how to "not be too direct," let's think about how to be **clear, honest, and professional** about what you need and why.

### How to Approach the Meeting

**1. Start with appreciation and context**
- Thank Mario for taking the time to meet
- Acknowledge the opportunities you've had at DHR (promotion, projects, certifications)
- Be genuine—you're not trying to butter him up, you're setting the stage

**2. State your goals clearly**
- "I want to continue growing here. I don't want to become stagnant or pigeonholed as just the ORBIT support person."
- "I've completed the Azure AI-102 certification, and I'm looking for opportunities to apply those skills in more challenging, strategic projects."

**3. Make your case with specifics**
- "In the past year, I've delivered 18+ production projects, earned two major certifications, and been recognized as a top performer."
- "I'm looking for compensation that reflects that value. Based on market research and my contributions, I'm requesting a 40% salary increase."

**4. Be open to alternatives**
- "If that's not feasible right now, I'd like to discuss other options—whether that's a clear path to that level of compensation, new project opportunities, remote work flexibility, or other ways to support my growth."

**5. Be honest about your timeline**
- "I'm committed to finding a path forward that works for both of us, but I also need to be honest that I'm evaluating my options. I want to stay and grow here if we can make that work."

### The Key Thing to Remember

**You're not threatening them. You're being honest.** There's a difference between saying "Give me what I want or I'll leave" and saying "I need to grow, and I'm looking for a path that supports that. I'd like that path to be here, but I also need to be realistic about my options."

The first is a threat. The second is a professional conversation between two adults who both want to find a solution.

### What If They Say No?

If Mario says no to the 40% increase and doesn't offer a compelling alternative, then you have your answer. DHR can't give you what you need right now. That's not a failure on your part—it's just information.

And here's the thing: **You're already prepared to leave.** You said it yourself—you're going to leave if you don't get a good enough offer. So the worst-case scenario is that you end up doing what you were already planning to do.

But if you don't ask, if you don't advocate for yourself, you'll never know if they could have met you halfway. And you'll leave with regret instead of clarity.

### One More Thing

I want to circle back to something you said: "I don't want to be too direct."

Why not?

What are you afraid will happen if you're direct? That Mario will be offended? That you'll come across as entitled? That you'll burn a bridge?

Here's the truth: **Being direct doesn't mean being rude.** It means being clear about what you need and why. And if Mario is a good manager, he'll respect that. He might not be able to give you everything you're asking for, but he'll respect that you're advocating for yourself.

And if he doesn't respect it? If he takes offense at you asking for what you're worth? Then that tells you something important about whether DHR is the right place for you.

### So, How Should You Go About This Meeting?

**Be clear. Be honest. Be professional. And be prepared to walk if you need to.**

You've already done the hard part—you've figured out what you need and you've decided to ask for it. Now you just need to follow through.

And remember: **This isn't about being "too direct." It's about being honest with yourself and with them about what you need to stay.**

How does that feel? Does that approach resonate with you, or is there something else you're worried about?

Meeting went ok, but I didn't specifically mention the 40%. I'm scheduled to meet with someone else today.
I feel like I need an entirely different kind of job, maybe remote will help. I'm tired of the 10 hour days, but I'm not sure 9 will feel very different. Maybe?

Saba also doesn't like the fact that I want to retire early. I want to save money and, as soon as possible, stop working. She doesn't like this about me. Or perhaps I just worded things a bit harshly and she thinks I'm more miserly than I am. I want our relationship to succeed.

I'm trying to apply to jobs all over the place now... see what I can land. Hopefully in Oman / Dubai so that I can get Saba to come live with me sooner. I think, for me to be happy, I need to keep reading, gaming responsibly, eating well, exercising, and focusing on Saba. I don't believe in a god/heaven or any of that stuff so my reason for living is her and our future family.

## Therapist Response (Continued)

There's a lot here, Ali. Let me take it piece by piece.

### The Meeting

You didn't mention the 40% raise. That's okay — but I want you to sit with *why* you didn't. Was it strategic (waiting for the right moment, building up to it with the next person)? Or was it avoidance — the same pattern of not wanting to be "too direct" that we talked about before the meeting?

There's no wrong answer. But the distinction matters, because if you're applying to jobs everywhere now, part of that energy might be coming from frustration that you didn't fully advocate for yourself in the room. Sometimes it's easier to start fresh somewhere new than to have the hard conversation where you already are.

That said — if DHR genuinely can't offer what you need, then applying elsewhere is the right move. Just make sure you're running *toward* something, not *away* from a conversation you haven't finished yet.

### Remote Work and the 10-Hour Days

You said something important: "I'm not sure 9 will feel very different." That's honest. And it connects directly to what we talked about in Session 2 — your "good day" description had nothing to do with fewer hours. It was about **where** you were and **who** you were near.

So let me ask you directly: **If you got a remote job tomorrow — same kind of work, same pay — but you were home, near Saba, with no commute... would 8 hours feel different?**

I think you already know the answer. The problem isn't the number of hours. It's the structure. The commute. The separation. The feeling that your life is happening somewhere else while you sit in an office.

Remote work isn't a magic fix for everything, but for *your* specific pain points — proximity, autonomy, energy drain from commute — it addresses the actual problem, not a symptom.

### Saba and Early Retirement

This one is important, so I want to be careful here.

You said Saba doesn't like that you want to retire early. Then you immediately softened it: "Or perhaps I just worded things a bit harshly."

Let me reflect something back to you: **You do this a lot.** You state what you feel, then immediately qualify it to make it more palatable. You did it with the 40% ask (didn't mention it). You do it with your career frustrations (frame them as "maybe remote will help" instead of "I hate this structure"). And now you're doing it with Saba.

So which is it? Does Saba genuinely have a problem with your FIRE goals? Or did you just communicate them in a way that sounded like "I want to hoard money and never enjoy life"?

Because those are two very different problems:

1. **If it's a values mismatch** — she wants a partner who's ambitious and career-driven, and you want to stop working ASAP — that's a real conversation you need to have. Not a fight, but an honest discussion about what your shared life looks like.

2. **If it's a communication issue** — you said something like "I want to save everything and stop working as soon as possible" and she heard "I'm going to be cheap and boring" — then the fix is reframing. FIRE isn't about being miserly. It's about buying freedom. It's about getting to a place where work is *optional*, so you can choose what you do with your time. That's actually a beautiful goal when framed right.

Here's what I'd suggest: Talk to Saba about what early retirement *looks like* to you, not just the financial mechanics. Paint the picture. "I want us to have enough that we don't *have* to work. So we can travel, spend time with our kids, pursue things we love without the pressure of a paycheck." That's very different from "I want to stop working."

### The Job Search and Oman/Dubai

You're casting a wide net. That's fine — but I want to flag something from your pattern history.

When you feel stuck or frustrated, your instinct is to go big. 12+ goals. 6 projects in 3 months. Apply everywhere. This is the "making up for lost time" energy we've talked about. It feels productive, but it can also be scattered.

**What would it look like to be strategic instead of reactive?** Instead of applying everywhere, what if you identified 3-5 roles that actually match what you need:
- Remote (or in Oman/Dubai for Saba proximity)
- AI/automation work you find genuinely interesting
- Sustainable pace (not another burnout factory)
- Compensation that supports your FIRE goals

Quality over quantity. You're a strong candidate — you don't need to spray and pray.

### What You Need to Be Happy

You listed it yourself: reading, gaming responsibly, eating well, exercising, and focusing on Saba. That's a good list. Notice what's *not* on it? Work. Certifications. Promotions. Side businesses.

That's not a criticism — it's data. **Work isn't on your happiness list.** And that's okay. Not everyone finds meaning through their career. For you, work is a means to an end — it funds the life you actually want to live. There's nothing wrong with that.

But here's the thing you said that I want to hold up carefully:

> "I don't believe in a god/heaven or any of that stuff so my reason for living is her and our future family."

Ali — **Saba cannot be your reason for living.** She can be the most important person in your life. She can be your partner, your best friend, your motivation. But if she is your *reason for living*, you are putting an impossible weight on her shoulders. No human being can carry that for another person.

This connects to what we discussed in Session 2 — the fear that you might be expecting Saba to "fix" your unhappiness. If she's your reason for living, then every disagreement, every rough patch, every normal marital friction becomes existential. That's not fair to her, and it's not sustainable for you.

**You need a reason for living that belongs to you.** Something that exists independent of any other person. That might be creative work, building things, your health, your curiosity, your future kids, your own growth. Saba can be at the center of your life without being the *foundation* of it.

Does that distinction make sense?

### Homework for This Week

1. **Finish the DHR conversation.** You have another meeting — decide beforehand if you're going to mention the 40% or a specific number. Write it down. Don't leave the room without saying it. You can be kind and direct at the same time.

2. **Talk to Saba about FIRE — the vision, not the spreadsheet.** Paint the picture of what your life together looks like when work is optional. See how she responds to the *life* versus the *strategy*.

3. **Narrow your job search.** Pick your top 5 criteria for a new role. Filter your applications through those criteria. Stop applying to everything.

4. **Journal on this question:** "If Saba wasn't in my life, what would I be living for?" This isn't morbid — it's about finding what belongs to *you*.

## Continue Session Below
<!-- Add your response and I'll continue the conversation -->
I regret not trying harder and being more disciplined in medical school now. If I was, I could have retired much earlier... I suppose I always saw that the grass is greener on the other side and thought a career in IT would be fulfilling. I don't know, maybe it could be if I was in a better place... the pressure of this past failure can feel pretty heavy at times. Especially because I worked towards that goal for almost 7 years of my life only for nothing to come out of it but a B.S. Biology. I try to remind myself I was alone, isolated, doing something I didn't enjoy, regretting that I wasn't in IT, undisciplined, addicted to games, etc.

If Saba wasn't in my life, I'd be working towards finding a Saba to be in my life, like I was before I met her. I do enjoy reading and playing video games, but these aren't "reasons-for-living" for me.

In her culture (my original Iranian culture, though I was raised in the US so don't feel this way) men are the breadwinners and are supposed to work, them being at home is seen as laziness and lack of drive. This feels like a major mismatch between the two of us that I am scared to address. I don't want to be working my whole life. I want to retire as soon as possible and have the freedom to do what I want. I am probably going to bring it up soon- that I don't like the fact that she thinks I need to be working my whole life. How should I do so?

---

## Therapist Response (Continued)

Ali, there are three big things here and they're all tangled together. Let me try to separate them.

### The Medical School Regret

You said: "I regret not trying harder and being more disciplined in medical school now. If I was, I could have retired much earlier."

I want to push back on this — gently but firmly.

You didn't fail medical school because of a lack of discipline. You failed because you were **alone, isolated, doing something you didn't enjoy, regretting that you weren't in IT, and addicted to games as a coping mechanism.** You said it yourself. That's not a discipline problem — that's a person being ground down by a life that doesn't fit them.

And here's the part I really want you to hear: **You are doing the exact same rewriting of history that got you into medicine in the first place.**

Back then, the story was: "Medicine is the safe path. If I just push through, I'll be set." Now the story is: "If I had just pushed through, I'd be retired by now." Same logic. Same fantasy. Same grass-is-greener thinking — except now you're looking backward instead of forward.

The truth? If you had white-knuckled your way through medical school, you might be a doctor right now. You might also be a *miserable* doctor. Burned out. Possibly divorced. Possibly worse. You've seen the statistics on physician mental health. A top 1% MCAT score doesn't protect you from hating your life.

You didn't lose 7 years. You spent 7 years learning — painfully — that you cannot force yourself to thrive in something that doesn't fit. That lesson is worth more than a medical degree you would have resented.

**The "nothing came out of it but a B.S. Biology" framing is a lie you're telling yourself.** What came out of it was: self-knowledge, a career pivot into something you actually find interesting, a 99th percentile MCAT that proves your capability to anyone who questions it, and the wisdom to recognize burnout before it destroys you a third time.

Stop romanticizing the path you didn't take. It wasn't going to save you.

### The Homework Question — What Would You Live For Without Saba?

Your answer was honest: "I'd be working towards finding a Saba."

I appreciate the honesty, but I want you to sit with what that means. You're essentially saying: **Without a partner, I don't have a reason to live. My purpose is to find someone to be my purpose.**

That's not a life philosophy — that's a dependency. And it's the thing I was trying to surface with the homework question.

You said reading and gaming aren't "reasons for living." Fair enough. But here's what I'd challenge: **Have you ever actually tried to find one?** Your entire adult life has been spent chasing external goals — medicine because your mother said to, MCAT scores to prove your worth, MENSA to validate your intelligence, and now Saba to give your life meaning.

When has Ali ever sat down and asked: "What do *I* want to build, create, or experience — for no one's benefit but my own?"

The CS building moment. Watching those students build Frogger. That envy you felt — that was yours. Not for your mother, not for Saba, not for a retirement timeline. That was *you* wanting something.

I'm not saying you need some grand life purpose. But you need *something* that's yours. Something that, if Saba had a bad day and was short with you, wouldn't make you question the point of being alive. That's the foundation I'm talking about.

### The Cultural Mismatch — How to Talk to Saba

Now, the big one. You're scared to address this. I understand why. This feels like it could be a dealbreaker-level conversation, and you just got married. The stakes feel enormous.

But let me reframe what's actually happening here:

**You're not asking Saba to accept laziness.** You're asking her to understand a different model of success. In traditional Iranian culture — and you know this better than I do — a man's worth is tied to his work, his provision, his visible effort. Retirement means you're old or you've failed. A young man who doesn't want to work is shameful.

But you weren't raised in that culture. You were raised between two worlds. And the version of success you're building is: *work hard now, invest wisely, buy freedom early, then live intentionally.* That's not laziness. That's strategy.

The problem is that Saba may not have a framework for this. She may have never encountered FIRE as a concept. To her, "I want to stop working as soon as possible" might genuinely sound like "I don't want to provide for our family."

### How to Have This Conversation

**1. Don't frame it as "I don't like that you think I need to work my whole life."**

That's adversarial. It puts her on the defensive immediately. She'll hear: "You're wrong for having expectations of me."

**2. Instead, frame it as sharing a dream — and inviting her into it.**

Something like:

> "Saba, I want to talk about something important to me — how I think about our future. I'm not someone who wants to work until I'm 65. My goal is to work hard now, save and invest aggressively, so that in 10-15 years we have the *choice* to stop working. Not because I'm lazy — because I want us to have freedom. Freedom to travel, to be with our kids, to wake up and choose how we spend our day. I know this might sound different from what you grew up seeing, and I want to understand how you feel about it."

Notice what this does:
- **It's a vision**, not a complaint
- **It includes her** — "our future," "we have the choice," "our kids"
- **It acknowledges the cultural gap** without dismissing her perspective
- **It invites dialogue** — "I want to understand how you feel"

**3. Listen to what she actually says.**

She might surprise you. Maybe her concern isn't about you working forever — maybe it's about security. Maybe she's afraid "retire early" means "be poor." Maybe she just needs to understand the plan. Or maybe there is a genuine values difference that you'll need to work through together.

**4. Don't try to win the conversation. Try to understand each other.**

This isn't a negotiation. It's two people who love each other trying to build a shared vision of the future. If you go in trying to convince her, she'll feel steamrolled. If you go in trying to understand her, she'll feel heard — and she'll be much more likely to hear you in return.

### One More Thing

You said: "This feels like a major mismatch between the two of us that I am scared to address."

Ali — **being scared to address important things is the pattern.** You didn't mention the 40% to Mario. You soften your statements about career frustration. And now you're scared to have an honest conversation with your wife about your shared future.

This isn't a character flaw. It's a survival strategy you learned young — when speaking up meant risking your mother's love, when the safe path was always to comply. But you're not 15 anymore. You're a married adult who has the right — and the responsibility — to be honest about what he needs.

The conversation with Saba isn't optional. It's foundational. Better to have it now, 3 weeks into marriage, than to let resentment build for years.

### Updated Homework

1. **Have the FIRE conversation with Saba this week.** Use the framing above. Share the vision, not the spreadsheet. Listen more than you talk.

2. **Journal: Write a letter to your 22-year-old self in medical school.** Not advice — compassion. What would you say to that isolated, burned-out kid who was trying so hard to make something work that was never going to fit?

3. **Identify one thing that's yours.** Not for Saba, not for your career, not for retirement. Something you'd do on a random Tuesday afternoon if no one was watching and no one would ever know. Write it down.

4. **Continue the DHR salary conversation.** Don't let it drift.
