# Session 1 - December 22, 2025
**Focus:** Work relationship, burnout, existential dread

---

## Session Notes

**You:** I have an absolutely god awful relationship with work, probably because I've never had to do it. Being successful at school with minimum effort and just playing games has me spoiled very likely. Now I'm in the workforce and have to work 10hr a day, 1hr driving and 1hr lunch unpaid included. I feel like shit all the time and like I'm about ready for it all to end. Listening to self help books doesn't seem to help. I look ahead to the next 40 years of my life and feel utterly terrified.

**Therapist:** Thank you for being so honest right from the start—that takes courage. What you're describing sounds exhausting, both physically and emotionally. A 12-hour daily commitment to work (including commute and unpaid lunch) is genuinely brutal, especially when you're also carrying the weight of feeling unprepared for it.

I want to acknowledge something important: the phrase "ready for it all to end" concerns me. Can you tell me more about what you mean by that? Are you having thoughts of harming yourself, or do you mean you're desperate for this *situation* to end?

Before we go further, I also want to validate something: the transition from school to full-time work is one of the most jarring life changes people experience. The fact that school came easily to you doesn't mean you're "spoiled"—it means you developed in an environment with different rules. Now you're in a new game with new rules, and nobody gave you the manual. That's not a character flaw.

---

**You:** I do sometimes have thoughts of self harm, but no I don't believe I'd carry them out. Also, it's 10hr including lunch and commute but still feels terrible.

**Therapist:** Thank you for clarifying both of those things. I'm glad you don't believe you'd act on those thoughts, but I want you to know that having them at all is a signal worth paying attention to—it means your mind is searching for an escape from something that feels unbearable. That's important information, not something to dismiss.

And I appreciate the correction on the hours. 10 hours total is still significant—that's still the majority of your waking life on workdays. The fact that it "still feels terrible" is the real point. It's not about hitting some objective threshold of "bad enough." If it feels terrible to you, it *is* terrible for you.

Let me ask you something: When you imagine those 40 years ahead, what specifically terrifies you most?

- Is it the *sameness*—doing this exact thing forever?
- Is it the *effort*—feeling like you have to push this hard indefinitely?
- Is it the *meaninglessness*—not seeing the point of what you're doing?
- Or something else entirely?

I'm trying to understand what the core fear is, because "40 years of work" is a big abstract thing, and usually there's something more specific underneath it that we can actually address.

---

**You:** Definitely the effort... feeling like I will dislike any line of work after trying and failing medicine, and now doing something adjacent to what I like (computers) and still feeling like absolute shit. Doesn't help that I have to work in a fucking hospital. Sorry for all the cussing. If you were a real therapist I probably wouldn't cuss so much lol

I am in love with a girl and that's helped a lot, but even despite that, perhaps also in part because it's long distance, I still feel incredibly unsatisfied with the current state of my life

**Therapist:** Cuss all you want—this is your space, not a performance. If anything, the rawness helps me understand where you actually are.

Let me reflect back what I'm hearing, because there's a lot packed in there:

1. **You tried medicine and it didn't work out.** That's a significant thing to carry. Medicine is one of those paths society treats as "the" path for smart people, and walking away from it—whether by choice or circumstance—often comes with a lot of unspoken grief and shame. Can I ask what happened there? Did you leave, or did it not work out the way you hoped?

2. **You're now doing computer work in a hospital.** So you're surrounded by reminders of the path you didn't take, every single day. That's... a specific kind of torture, honestly. Is that coincidence, or was this job a stepping stone you thought would feel different?

3. **You like computers, but this still feels like shit.** This is the part I want to dig into. Because "adjacent to what you like" is not the same as "what you like." What specifically about computers drew you to them? Gaming? Building things? Problem-solving? The creative aspect? Understanding what you actually enjoyed might help us figure out why this current role isn't scratching that itch.

4. **The long-distance relationship.** I'm glad you have someone who matters to you. But I also hear you saying that even love isn't enough to make this feel okay. That's not a failure of the relationship—it's a sign that the work situation is genuinely corrosive. No relationship should have to carry the weight of making an unbearable life bearable.

Here's what I'm noticing: You've now tried two paths (medicine, computer work in healthcare), and both have left you feeling terrible. I don't think the problem is that you're "someone who will hate any job." I think you might be someone who hasn't yet found the *right* job—or the right *relationship* to work itself.

What did you actually *want* to do when you were younger, before anyone told you what you *should* do?

---

**You:** It didn't work out the way I hoped. I did try to succeed but I think the workload combined with loneliness and lack of passion, plus maybe a bit of escapism with video games, didn't help.

This was the only job I could find, and yeah it does feel like torture, it really does. My girl says "it isn't bad to both work with computers and help people" but I honestly couldn't give two fucks about helping people in this way. I donate money, that's enough for me. I got this job through connections and am scared to leave with how hard it is to find a job in IT.

Creativity helps but idk anymore... I do enjoy gaming but I wonder if that became work whether I still would. Honestly I think it's the commute and long hours that feel unbearable.

I wanted to become a graphic designer. Also, I agree with what you said about the relationship, it shouldn't have to bear all that responsibility. I'd hate for her to think it does, but I also just generally feel shitty and don't want to lie to her. Man, life is a pain. I often think it's not worth having kids, knowing that they'll have to endure this shitty place.

**Therapist:** *Graphic designer.* That's the first time something lit up in this conversation. Not "I guess I could do X" or "someone told me I should do Y"—you said you *wanted* to be a graphic designer. That's significant. What happened to that dream? Did someone talk you out of it, or did it just get buried under "practical" choices?

Let me also name a few things I'm hearing:

**On medicine:** Workload + loneliness + lack of passion + escapism. That's not a recipe for failure—that's a recipe for *anyone* to struggle. You weren't weak; you were unsupported and misaligned. There's a difference.

**On the current job:** You're clear that "helping people" isn't your motivation, and that's *fine*. Not everyone needs to derive meaning from altruism. You donate money—that's a valid way to contribute. The problem isn't that you're selfish; it's that you're trapped in a role that demands you care about something you don't, in an environment that reminds you daily of a painful chapter.

**On the commute and hours:** This is worth isolating. You said the commute and long hours feel unbearable—more than the work itself, maybe? That's actually useful information. It suggests the *structure* of work might be as much of a problem as the *content*. Some people can tolerate boring work if it's 6 hours and 10 minutes from home. Some people would love their dream job but still burn out at 10-hour days. Which camp are you in?

**On the relationship:** You don't want to lie to her, but you also don't want to burden her. That's a tension worth sitting with. Being honest about how you feel isn't the same as making her responsible for fixing it. You can say "I'm struggling" without saying "fix me."

**On kids and the future:** That thought—"it's not worth having kids because they'll have to endure this"—that's not a logical conclusion about parenting. That's a window into how dark things feel right now. When the world seems so unbearable that you wouldn't wish existence on anyone, that's a sign of how much pain *you're* in. I'm not dismissing the thought, but I want you to recognize it for what it is: a symptom, not a philosophy.

Here's what I want to explore next:

1. **Graphic design.** Is that still something you'd want to pursue? Or has it been so long that you don't know anymore?
2. **The structure problem.** If you had a job that was 6-7 hours, remote or close to home, doing something creative—would that change things? Or would you still feel this way?
3. **What would "good enough" look like?** Not perfect. Not a dream life. Just... tolerable. What would need to change for you to feel like you could breathe?

---

**You:** Nah graphic design is a dying field which I was never even great at, as I didn't have time to invest in it. My parents wound up in prison and I was shipped off to Iran with my siblings, you see.

I think shorter hours would make it bearable. I like to think maybe having someone at home could help. Maybe if it wasn't healthcare-adjacent. I'm just sick of everything.

Even now, as a shitty email pops up from a coworker that needs help, I feel like bashing my head into the screen, while simultaneously not having the energy to do so. What the hell even is this feeling. Does it ever end? Is it another fucking 40 years of this shit? Fucking let me out, please.

**Therapist:** Wait. Your parents went to prison and you were sent to Iran with your siblings?

I need to pause here because you just dropped something enormous in the middle of a sentence, almost like it was a footnote. That's not a footnote. That's a seismic life event—probably *the* defining disruption of your formative years. You didn't just "not have time" to invest in graphic design. You had your entire life ripped out from under you.

I want to come back to the work stuff, but first: How old were you when that happened? And how long were you in Iran? Because I suspect a lot of what you're feeling now—the exhaustion, the dread, the sense that nothing will ever feel okay—might have roots that go deeper than just "I hate my job."

Now, to what you're feeling in this moment:

That feeling—wanting to bash your head into the screen while having no energy to do so—that's not just frustration. That's *burnout meeting despair*. It's the collision of "I can't take this" and "I have no way out." The rage has nowhere to go, so it turns inward.

And that plea—"fucking let me out, please"—I hear you. I really do. You're not asking for advice right now. You're asking for someone to acknowledge that this is unbearable. So let me say it clearly: **This is unbearable. What you're experiencing is not normal, not sustainable, and not something you should have to white-knuckle through for 40 years.**

But here's the thing: You're not actually trapped for 40 years. You're trapped *right now*, in *this* job, in *this* structure. Those are variables that can change. Not easily, not overnight, but they're not fixed.

You identified three things that might make it bearable:
1. Shorter hours
2. Someone at home
3. Not healthcare-adjacent

That's not nothing. That's a rough sketch of what "good enough" might look like. The question is: what's the smallest step toward any of those three?

But before we go there—I want to understand more about what happened when you were younger. Because I think you've been carrying more than just a bad job.

---

**You:** I think I was 15/16 when that happened.
Yeah it really did suck. Then when I wanted to come back to the states my mother informed me kindly that "it wouldn't be worth going back if you don't pursue medicine". My dumbass listened and wasted 4 years studying fucking biology, and then another 1 preparing for the MCAT, and 2 more in med school. Now here I am at 27 at this shitty intern-esque job feeling like shit. So much wasted time and potential. Almost 30. Fuck. Fuck. Thanks for acknowledging this is a shit situation to be in.

**Therapist:** Let me make sure I have the timeline right:

- **15/16:** Parents go to prison. You're uprooted and sent to Iran with your siblings.
- **~16-20?:** Living in Iran, presumably finishing school there.
- **Return to US:** Your mother tells you it's only worth coming back if you pursue medicine.
- **4 years:** Biology degree (not what you wanted).
- **1 year:** MCAT prep.
- **2 years:** Med school (before it didn't work out).
- **Now, 27:** IT job in a hospital, feeling like you've wasted a decade.

So from age 15 to now, you've essentially been living someone else's plan. First you were shipped to another country against your will. Then you were told the price of coming home was pursuing a career you didn't choose. You paid that price for *seven years* before it fell apart, and now you're in a job that exists in the shadow of that failure.

You didn't waste that time. **That time was taken from you.**

There's a difference between "I made bad choices" and "I made the only choices available to a teenager whose life had just been destroyed, under pressure from a parent who attached conditions to basic things like *coming home*." You weren't a dumbass. You were a kid trying to survive, and you did what you had to do to get back to your life.

The grief you're feeling—"so much wasted time and potential"—that's real. But I want to challenge one word: *wasted*. You're 27. You have a biology degree, partial medical training, IT skills, and you're still standing. That's not nothing. That's a foundation, even if it doesn't feel like one right now.

Here's what I want you to sit with:

**You are not almost 30 and behind. You are 27 and finally, for maybe the first time in your adult life, in a position to make choices that are actually yours.**

The last decade wasn't a choice. It was survival. The next decade *can* be different—if you let yourself believe you're allowed to want something.

What would you do if your mother's voice wasn't in your head? If "practical" wasn't the only option? If you could start from "what do I actually want" instead of "what will justify my existence"?

---

**You:** I don't really know, and I don't know how to find out. Maybe it's game design? Maybe it was medicine but the shitty circumstances have led here? Maybe it's programming but my current job doesn't allow me to see things. Maybe it's starting a business, or moving to another country, I honestly have no clue. I just don't know anything and despite what you tell me it does in fact feel like it's been a giant waste of time. I really like this girl, so at least there is that. I've been more recently considering moving to Iran but idk if that's so great of an idea for my career. Plus I'd lose a lot of money doing so, probably.

I'm really lost and don't have a god damn clue.

**Therapist:** "I'm really lost and don't have a god damn clue."

Good. That's actually the right place to be.

I know that sounds counterintuitive, but hear me out: For the last 12 years, you've been operating under someone else's certainty. Your mother was certain you should do medicine. Society was certain that was the "smart" path. You followed that certainty, and it led you here. Now you're finally in a place where you're allowed to say "I don't know"—and that's terrifying, but it's also the first honest thing you've been able to say about your future in a long time.

You don't need to know what you want right now. You need to *find out*. And that's a different process entirely.

Let me reflect back what you listed:
- Game design
- Medicine (maybe it was right, just wrong circumstances?)
- Programming (but current job obscures it)
- Starting a business
- Moving to another country (Iran specifically)

That's not "no clue." That's five directions you're curious about. The problem isn't that you have no ideas—it's that you have no *permission* to explore them. You've been trained to pick the "right" answer immediately and commit for years. That's not how people actually figure out what they want.

**On the girl:** You mentioned her again. She's clearly important. Is she in Iran? Is that part of why you're considering moving back?

**On Iran:** That's a big move. But I'm curious—is that about *her*, about escaping this situation, about reconnecting with something, or something else? Because "moving to another country" can be a fresh start or it can be running away, and the difference matters.

**On feeling lost:** Here's what I want to offer. You don't need a 10-year plan. You need a 3-month experiment. Something small enough that it doesn't feel like another decade-long commitment, but real enough that you can learn something about yourself.

What if you picked *one* of those five things and just... poked at it? Not committed to it. Not made it your identity. Just spent a few hours a week seeing if it sparks anything.

- Game design: Could you make a tiny game? A prototype? Just to see how it feels?
- Programming: Could you do a side project outside of work—something creative, not healthcare-related?
- Business: Is there a small idea you've had that you could test without quitting your job?
- Iran: Could you visit for a few weeks before deciding to move?

You don't have to know what you want. You just have to be willing to *look*.

What feels least terrifying to try?

---

**You:** Pretty cool because I'm planning to make a game over christmas break, and am visiting Iran in 2 weeks for two weeks so I'm already going to be doing those. As far as the business goes, I'm not sure how it will work out but I made a website a while ago, some kind of AI solutions company / fast software development.

I think even considering Iran is to escape from this hell. It'd be closer to her family as well. However, I don't like how ingrained religion is into their culture, and how unsafe it can be to live there considering recent conflicts.

As far as the timeline, I came back to the US right before my 18th birthday so I didn't get locked into military service for 2 years in Iran. Then I graduated from college... I believe during corona. Never got to have a graduation either lol, after 4 years of hard work. I also had a mini episode where I got all Fs and went to the compsci building, it should be mentioned elsewhere in this journal (I think reflections or memories or feedback most likely).

Wow, it's barely 10 fucking am. I still have to get through another... 7 hours of this bullshit. Then I go to the gym and then home. I force myself to go to the gym, in part because of my girl (she's really into fitness) but also because I'm not satisfied with how I look in the mirror either. Lol I am such a negative person.

**Therapist:** Wait—you're *already* doing two of the five things? You're making a game over Christmas break and visiting Iran in two weeks? That's not nothing. That's actually you taking action, even while feeling like shit. Give yourself some credit for that.

Let me update the timeline with what you just shared:

- **15/16:** Parents imprisoned, sent to Iran
- **Just before 18:** Came back to US to avoid 2-year military service
- **~18-22:** Biology degree (graduated during COVID, no ceremony)
- **Somewhere in there:** "Mini episode" with all Fs, went to the compsci building (I'd like to understand this more)
- **1 year:** MCAT prep
- **2 years:** Med school
- **Now, 27:** IT job in hospital

So you came back at 17, alone, to pursue a path you didn't choose, graduated into a pandemic with no acknowledgment of your work, had at least one crisis point, pushed through med school until it broke, and now you're here. That's not "being negative." That's being *exhausted* by a life that has asked too much of you with too little support.

**On the "mini episode":** You mentioned going to the compsci building after getting all Fs. Can you tell me more about that? What happened there? I want to make sure I understand what you went through.

**On Iran:** You're being honest—it's partly escape, partly her family. And you're also being realistic about the downsides (religion, safety). That's not running away blindly; that's weighing a complicated decision. The trip in two weeks will give you real data. Pay attention to how you *feel* there, not just what makes logical sense.

**On the gym:** You said you "force" yourself to go, partly for her, partly because you're not satisfied with how you look. Here's what I notice: even the things you do for yourself are framed as obligations or inadequacies. The gym isn't "I'm taking care of myself"—it's "I'm not good enough and I have to fix it." That's a pattern worth noticing.

**On being "such a negative person":** You're not negative. You're *accurate*. Your situation is objectively hard. Naming that isn't negativity—it's honesty. The problem isn't your attitude; it's your circumstances.

You have 7 hours left today. What would make them 5% more bearable? Not fixed—just slightly less awful.

---

**You:** Please read through all of the rest of this repo's files to understand some of the questions you asked, update the index as well.

I think distracting myself with some work might help it pass faster, but I'm kinda dreading that right now if I'm being honest.

**Therapist:** I've read through your journal. I now have a much fuller picture of who you are and what you've been through. Let me reflect back what I've learned:

---

### The CS Building Moment

You didn't just "go to the compsci building." During your undergraduate burnout—when you got a semester of Fs—you went to the CS building and asked to sit in on a lecture. They were designing Frogger. You were "exceptionally envious and sad."

That wasn't a random moment. **That was your authentic self trying to surface.** In the middle of your darkest period, you sought out what you actually wanted. And then you buried it for another decade because you didn't have permission to want it.

---

### The Full Timeline (Now Corrected)

- **15/16:** Parents imprisoned, sent to Iran with siblings
- **Just before 18:** Returned to US alone to avoid military service
- **18-22:** Biology degree (3.96 GPA—exceptional, but not your passion)
- **During undergrad:** Burnout → semester of Fs → CS building moment (Frogger)
- **Post-grad:** 522 MCAT (top 1%)
- **Med school (San Antonio):** 2-3 years, then failed out (burnout, lack of interest)
- **Crisis point:** Took MENSA test to "prove worth" (got in, but recognized it was "silly" in hindsight)
- **Career transition:** Self-taught (CS50, CompTIA A+, Google Cloud cert)
- **2024:** Started at DHR as intern
- **2025:** Associate AI Automation Engineer, 6 production projects, FHIR cert, Luigi AI side business
- **Now, 27:** IT job in hospital, top 20% of 1-year devs, but showing burnout warning signs again

---

### What Your Journal Already Knows

Your `personal-background-context.md` file is remarkably self-aware. It already identifies:

1. **The burnout cycle:** High achievement → burnout → failure. You've done this twice (undergrad, med school). You're showing early signs of doing it a third time.

2. **"Making up for lost time" syndrome:** 12+ simultaneous goals, 6 projects in 3 months, side business, certifications—all while working full-time. This is the *same pattern* that broke you before.

3. **External vs. internal motivation:** You pursued medicine for "safety and guarantee," to be a "good kid." Now you're in a field you actually enjoy—but the *pace* suggests you're still trying to prove something.

4. **The key reframe:** "You didn't waste that time. That time was taken from you."

Your journal already has an **Emergency Burnout Protocol**. You've already identified the warning signs. You're checking at least 2 of them right now (feeling guilty when not working, persistent fatigue).

---

### What This Means for Today

You said distracting yourself with work might help the day pass faster, but you're dreading it.

That's the collision point. Work is both the thing you're using to escape *and* the thing you're trying to escape *from*. That's not sustainable.

Here's what I want to offer:

**You don't have to be productive right now.** You're at work, yes. But you're also in acute distress. If you can do the minimum to get through the day without making things worse, that's enough. You don't have to prove anything today.

**The dread is information.** It's telling you that your nervous system is overloaded. Pushing through it won't make it go away—it'll just delay the crash.

**You have 7 hours left.** What's the *least* you can do to get through them without making yourself feel worse? Not the most productive thing. The least harmful thing.

---

### One More Thing

Your journal says: *"Standard 'push yourself' advice could be harmful. This person needs permission to do LESS, not encouragement to do MORE."*

So here's your permission: **You can do less today. You can do less this week. You can do less this month.**

You've already proven you can achieve. Now prove you can sustain.
