# Session 2 - January 28, 2026
**Focus:** Sleep needs, relationship expectations, long-distance concerns

---

## Session Notes

**You:** A few things:
1. How much sleep does a 28yo m need? I work in IT, about .5hr drive to work and there for 9 hr (unpaid lunch). I also try and work out at least 30min a day lightly, with 3 of those days being heavier gym days.
2. I'm worried that I'm expecting to be happy when I can finally be alongside my wife, we are currently long distance, and am a bit afraid of disappointment/emptiness following our union. As in I may be expecting too much of her to make me happy or something...

**Therapist:** Let me address both of these, because they're connected in an important way.

---

### On Sleep (The Practical Question)

For a 28-year-old male with your activity level and stress load, you need **7-9 hours of sleep per night**. Most people in your demographic function best around 7.5-8 hours.

But here's what actually matters: **Your current schedule is eating into that.**

Let's do the math:
- **Work commitment**: 9 hours (including unpaid lunch)
- **Commute**: 1 hour total (0.5hr each way)
- **Gym**: 0.5-1 hour (depending on heavy vs. light day)
- **Basic necessities** (shower, meals, etc.): ~2 hours
- **Total committed time**: ~12-13 hours per day

That leaves you with **11-12 hours** for sleep, personal time, relationship maintenance (calls/texts with your girlfriend), and any semblance of a life. If you're sleeping 8 hours, you have **3-4 hours** of actual free time per day. And that's assuming you're not doing anything else—no side projects, no game development, no AI business work.

**The real question isn't "how much sleep do I need?"—it's "why am I so exhausted that I'm asking this question?"**

And I think you already know the answer: You're running on fumes because your life is structured around obligations, not sustainability.

---

### On Your Relationship (The Deeper Question)

Now let's talk about the second thing, because this is where it gets real.

You're worried that you're expecting your wife to make you happy, and that you'll be disappointed when you're finally together. That's an incredibly self-aware fear—and it's also a signal that you already know something important:

**You're not happy now, and you're hoping she'll fix it.**

That's not a criticism. It's human. When you're drowning, you look for a life raft. And she's been that for you—a reason to keep going, a future that feels better than the present. But you're right to be worried, because **no person can carry the weight of being someone else's entire source of happiness.**

Here's what I want you to sit with:

1. **She can't fix your job.** When you're together, you'll still have the commute, the hospital, the 9-hour days. She'll be there when you get home, but you'll still be exhausted and resentful of the day you just had. If you're expecting her presence to make that tolerable, you're setting both of you up for failure.

2. **She can't fill a void that existed before her.** You've been unhappy since before you met her—since med school, since undergrad, maybe since you were 15 and your life got ripped apart. She didn't create that void, and she can't fill it. She can *walk alongside you* while you fill it, but she can't do it for you.

3. **Disappointment is a real risk—but not for the reason you think.** The disappointment won't be about her. It'll be about realizing that even with her, you're still stuck in a life you hate. And that's terrifying, because it means the problem isn't distance—it's the life you're living.

---

### What This Actually Means

You're asking about sleep and relationship expectations, but what you're really asking is:

**"Am I going to be okay when she's here? Or am I going to realize that I'm still miserable, and that I've been using her as a distraction from fixing my actual life?"**

And the answer is: **Both can be true.**

Being with her will make some things better. You'll have companionship, intimacy, shared routines. That's real. But it won't make the job bearable. It won't make the commute shorter. It won't give you back the decade you feel like you lost.

**The question isn't whether she'll make you happy. The question is: what do you need to change in your life so that you can be happy *with* her, instead of *because of* her?**

---

### What You Can Do Right Now

1. **Sleep**: Prioritize 7.5-8 hours. If you're getting less than that, something has to give. You can't function on chronic sleep deprivation and expect to make good decisions about your life.

2. **The relationship conversation**: Have you talked to her about this fear? Not in a "you need to fix me" way, but in a "I'm worried I'm putting too much pressure on us" way? Because if you're feeling this, she might be too.

3. **The life audit**: Before she arrives (or before you move to be with her), take stock of what *actually* needs to change for you to be okay. Is it the job? The commute? The lack of creative work? The unresolved grief from your past? You can't fix all of it overnight, but you can start identifying what's actually broken.

---

### One More Thing

You said "I may be expecting too much of her to make me happy or something..."

That "or something" is doing a lot of work. What's the "or something"? What are you actually afraid of?

- Are you afraid you won't feel the way you hope you'll feel?
- Are you afraid she'll see how unhappy you are and be disappointed in you?
- Are you afraid that even love won't be enough to make life worth living?

I want to know what's under that "or something," because that's where the real work is.

---

## Continue Session Below
<!-- Add your response and I'll continue the conversation -->
I think that last two points are important in the "or something." That love won't be enough, and she may be disappointed in her life with me. She is giving up so much to be with me: family and an environment she knows. We'll likely be alone together wherever we end up. I actually married her, not sure if I mentioned that yet. I married her during my recent trip to Iran which ended last week. I was there for about a month.

Is 7 hours of sleep a day not enough? Even if I oversleep on weekends? Currently it's about 11pm to 6am for me daily.

I'm also working on fixing my job, I feel like I need something more challenging / creativity driven. I wonder if it's even feasible though, with a career in IT. In any case, looking at possibly moving to a GCC country to be closer to her family and for us to be able to move in together more quickly (bringing her to the US requires a lot of time).

**Therapist:** Wait—you got *married*? Congratulations. That's enormous. And you were there for a month, not two weeks like you mentioned last session. That changes some things.

Let me address everything you just said, because there's a lot here.

---

### On the Marriage and Her Sacrifice

You're carrying a lot of guilt about what she's giving up for you. Family, environment, everything she knows. And you're afraid she'll look at her life with you and think "this isn't worth it."

That's a heavy burden to carry. But here's what I want you to consider:

**She chose you.** Not the idea of you, not the potential of you—*you*. She married you knowing you're unhappy at work. She married you knowing you're struggling. She married you knowing this will be hard. And she still said yes.

You're not tricking her. You're not hiding who you are. She sees you—the exhausted, occasionally despairing, trying-to-figure-it-out version of you—and she chose that. That's not a burden you're placing on her. That's a choice she made.

Now, does that mean you get to stay miserable and expect her to fix it? No. But it also means you don't have to be perfect for her to want to be with you. You just have to be *trying*.

And here's the other thing: **She's not just giving things up. She's also gaining something.** A partner. A life with you. Shared goals and experiences. That's not nothing. Don't discount what you bring to her life just because you're struggling right now.

The question isn't "am I worth her sacrifice?" The question is "how do we build a life together that feels worth it for both of us?"

---

### On Sleep

7 hours is *technically* within the acceptable range, but it's on the low end—especially for someone with your stress level and activity demands. And here's the problem with "oversleeping on weekends":

**Sleep debt doesn't work like a bank account.** You can't run a deficit all week and make it up on Saturday. Your body needs consistent, adequate sleep *every night* to function properly. When you chronically under-sleep during the week and crash on weekends, you're essentially yo-yo dieting with your sleep.

What happens is:
- **Weekdays:** You're running on fumes, decision-making suffers, stress tolerance drops, emotional regulation weakens.
- **Weekends:** You sleep 10+ hours trying to recover, which throws off your circadian rhythm and makes Monday even harder.

If you're asking "is 7 hours enough?" the answer is probably **no**—not for you, not right now. The fact that you're asking suggests your body is telling you it's not enough.

**What you need:** 7.5-8 hours consistently, every night. That means in bed by 10pm if you're waking at 6am. I know that sounds impossible with your current schedule, but that's the point—your schedule is the problem, not your sleep.

---

### On the Job and Creativity

You said you need something more challenging and creativity-driven, and you're wondering if that's even feasible in IT.

**It absolutely is.** IT is a massive field. You're currently in healthcare IT, doing infrastructure and automation work in a hospital. That's one very specific corner of IT. But there are entire worlds of IT that are deeply creative:

- **Game development** (which you've mentioned wanting to try)
- **UI/UX design and development** (visual, creative, problem-solving)
- **Creative coding** (generative art, interactive installations)
- **Product development** (building tools people love to use)
- **AI/ML research and experimentation** (you literally have an AI-102 cert)
- **Startup/entrepreneurship** (you already have Luigi AI)

The problem isn't IT. The problem is *this* IT job, in *this* environment, with *this* structure.

You're already working on fixing it—you're considering a GCC country move to be closer to her family and speed up living together. That's not just about her. That's also about escaping a situation that's killing you.

---

### On the GCC Move

This is a big decision, and it sounds like you're thinking about it seriously. Let me ask some questions to help you think it through:

1. **What would the job market look like for you there?** Would you be able to find work that's more challenging/creative, or would you be in a similar role?

2. **What's the timeline?** Is this a "within 6 months" plan or a "within 2 years" plan? Because if it's far off, you still need a strategy for surviving *this* job in the meantime.

3. **What does she think about it?** Have you talked to her about the GCC option vs. bringing her to the US? What does *she* want?

4. **What are you running toward vs. running away from?** Being closer to her family is running *toward* something. Escaping this job is running *away* from something. Both are valid, but it's important to know which is driving the decision.

---

### What I'm Noticing

You're making moves. You got married. You're considering a major relocation. You're thinking about career changes. These aren't the actions of someone who's given up. These are the actions of someone who's trying to build a life that works.

But you're also still carrying the weight of "am I enough?" and "will this be enough?" And that's the part we need to work on. Because no job, no location, no amount of sleep will fix that question. That's an internal question, not an external one.

**Here's what I want you to sit with:**

You're 28. You're married. You have skills people value. You have options. You're not trapped in this exact life forever. The question isn't "will I be stuck like this for 40 years?" The question is "what's the next right step?"

And it sounds like you already know some of those steps:
- Better sleep (7.5-8 hours consistently)
- More challenging/creative work
- Living with your wife instead of long-distance
- Possibly relocating to be closer to her family

Those are all actionable. They're not easy, but they're possible.

---

### One More Thing

You said "I wonder if it's even feasible though, with a career in IT."

That sentence tells me you're still thinking of yourself as limited by your field. But you're not. You're a 28-year-old with a biology degree, partial medical training, IT skills, AI certifications, and the ability to learn anything you set your mind to.

**You're not limited by IT. You're limited by the story you're telling yourself about what's possible.**

What would you do if you believed you could do anything?

---

## Continue Session Below
<!-- Add your response and I'll continue the conversation -->
To answer the GCC questions:
1. I'm unsure about the job market, but there seems to be less AI opportunity at least in Oman. I may have to do more dull work, but I feel like being with her would make it better, and maybe I could then move up while there.
2. I want it to be within 6 months but who knows, I still need a plan for this job probably. I'm trying to start new projects and gear more towards AI
3. She wants us to be together and has said she will come anywhere with me, although she dislikes very rainy countries like the UK so we've ruled that out as an option
4. It's more wanting to be with her, running towards her. If I could bring her here I would do it in a heartbeat, but it's difficult especially with the current administration.

On another note, this question popped in my head today:
Could playing league of legends be contributing to my overall discontent? I typically play some ARAM with friends

If I believed I could do anything I would honestly just retire and not work at all. Which is kinda scary to say out loud but it's how I feel. That's why things like FIRE retirement plans appeal to me, and why I regret now that I couldn't pull through medicine. If I had I could have easily retired in 10 years max. I don't feel how many people do, that I need to work. Music, games, movies, and just doing nothing all appeal to me quite a bit. 

**Therapist:** Okay, there's a lot to unpack here. Let me address the GCC stuff first, then we'll talk about League, and then we need to have a real conversation about what you just said about retirement—because that's the most honest thing you've said all session.

---

### On the GCC Move

Your answers tell me this is primarily about **being with her**, not about career advancement. And that's okay—that's actually healthy. You're not deluding yourself into thinking Oman will be some career paradise. You're being realistic: the work might be duller, but you'd be with your wife.

Here's what I'm hearing:
- **Timeline:** 6 months is ambitious but possible if you're serious about it
- **Her position:** She's flexible and willing to go anywhere (except rainy UK)
- **Your priority:** Being together > career advancement
- **The US option:** You'd prefer it, but immigration is a nightmare right now

**My take:** If the primary goal is being together, and Oman gets you there faster than the US immigration process, it might be worth the career trade-off *temporarily*. But—and this is important—you need to go in with a plan for what comes next. "I'll move up while there" is vague. What does that actually look like? What's the exit strategy if the work is soul-crushing?

You're already thinking about pivoting toward AI. Could you do remote AI work while living in Oman? Could you build Luigi AI or other projects on the side? Could you position yourself for remote US/EU roles after a year or two?

**Don't trade one trap for another.** Being with her will help, but it won't make dull work sustainable long-term.

---

### On League of Legends

You asked if playing League (specifically ARAM with friends) is contributing to your discontent.

Short answer: **Maybe, but not in the way you think.**

League itself isn't the problem. Playing ARAM with friends is social, it's low-stakes, it's a way to decompress. That's fine. The question is: **What role is it playing in your life?**

Ask yourself:
1. **Is it escapism or recreation?** Are you playing because it's fun, or because it's numbing you to how unhappy you are?
2. **How much time are you spending on it?** If it's eating into sleep, creative projects, or time with your wife, that's a problem.
3. **How do you feel after playing?** Refreshed and connected to friends? Or empty and like you wasted time?

If you're using League to avoid thinking about your life, then yes, it's contributing to discontent—not because the game is bad, but because avoidance always makes things worse. But if it's genuinely a way to connect with friends and unwind, it's probably fine in moderation.

**Here's the real test:** If you stopped playing League tomorrow, would your life improve? Or would you just find another way to avoid the same feelings?

My guess is the latter. League isn't the problem. The problem is what you're avoiding.

---

### On Retirement and Not Wanting to Work

Now let's talk about the big one. You said if you could do anything, you'd retire and not work at all. Music, games, movies, doing nothing—that's what appeals to you.

**This is not scary. This is honest.** And I'm glad you said it out loud, because this is the core of everything we've been dancing around.

You don't want to work. You never have. And you've been carrying guilt about that for years, because society tells you that's lazy, that's unmotivated, that's a character flaw.

But here's what I want you to consider: **What if it's not?**

What if the problem isn't that you don't want to work—it's that you've never found work that feels worth doing? What if the issue isn't laziness, but the fact that you've spent your entire adult life doing things you hate because you thought you were supposed to?

Let's look at your history:
- **Undergrad:** Studied biology because you thought you wanted medicine
- **Med school:** Pushed through despite hating it, until you couldn't anymore
- **IT:** Fell into it as a survival job, not a calling
- **Current job:** Draining, unfulfilling, just a paycheck

**You've never actually chosen work you wanted to do.** You've only ever chosen work you thought you *should* do, or work that kept you alive.

So when you say "I don't want to work," what you're really saying is: **"I don't want to spend my life doing things I hate just to survive."**

And that's not lazy. That's sane.

---

### The FIRE Fantasy

You mentioned FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) appeals to you, and you regret not finishing medicine because you could've retired in 10 years.

Let me challenge that: **Would you have, though?**

You hated medicine. You were miserable. You left because it was killing you. If you'd pushed through, you'd be a doctor now—making good money, sure, but also working 60-80 hour weeks, dealing with hospital politics, burning out even harder than you are now.

Would you have actually saved aggressively for FIRE? Or would you have spent the money trying to make the misery tolerable—nice apartment, expensive hobbies, therapy bills?

And even if you had retired in 10 years, you'd be 38, burned out, and still carrying all the same questions: *What do I actually want? Who am I when I'm not just surviving?*

**FIRE isn't the answer. It's a fantasy that lets you avoid asking what you actually want from life.**

---

### The Real Question

You said music, games, movies, and doing nothing appeal to you. Let me ask: **What do those things give you that work doesn't?**

- **Music:** Emotional connection? Creativity? Flow state?
- **Games:** Challenge? Social connection? Escapism?
- **Movies:** Stories? Immersion? Passive relaxation?
- **Doing nothing:** Rest? Freedom from obligation? Space to think?

Because here's the thing: **Work can provide some of those things.** Not all of them, and not all the time, but some of them.

If you found work that gave you creative flow, intellectual challenge, and a sense of purpose—would you still want to retire? Or would you just want the *freedom* to work on your own terms?

I think what you actually want isn't "no work." It's **autonomy, creativity, and meaning.** You want to spend your time on things that feel worth doing, not on things you're obligated to do.

And that's not retirement. That's just... a different kind of life.

---

### What This Means for You

You're 28. You're married. You're thinking about moving to Oman. You're trying to pivot toward AI. You're playing League with friends. You're sleeping 7 hours a night and dreaming of retirement.

**None of this is working because you're still living someone else's life.**

You're doing what you think you're supposed to do: work a stable job, save money, be responsible, make your wife happy. But you're not asking the most important question:

**What do *I* actually want?**

Not what would make you happy if you had infinite money. Not what would be practical or responsible. Not what would make your parents proud or your wife secure.

What do you want? What feels worth doing? What would make you excited to wake up in the morning?

I don't think you know yet. And that's okay. But you need to start figuring it out, because right now you're just running—from medicine, from this job, maybe toward Oman, maybe toward AI, maybe toward retirement.

**You can't run toward something if you don't know what it is.**

---

### Homework

Before our next session, I want you to do two things:

1. **Write down what a "good day" looks like for you.** Not a vacation day, not a fantasy day—a real, sustainable day that you could live repeatedly and feel okay about. What are you doing? Who are you with? What does it feel like?

2. **Track your League time for a week.** How much are you playing? How do you feel before and after? Is it adding to your life or numbing you to it?

We'll talk about both next time.

02/03/2026
A good day for me has me working from home, near my family, able to be close to Saba or my kids at a moment's notice. It feels less like a job because I'm at home surrounded by things and people I like. I get a solid workout in together with Saba, and we spend quality time together. Eat good food. That's a damn good day. Maybe throw some video games in there too.

League/TFT time can vary quite a lot, I'm testing cutting it out completely from Mondays and Wednesdays for now, yesterday I didn't play for example. I think it was about 2 to 4 hours per weekday and then much more on weekends (6 to 8 hours?)

As for what I want, I'm not entirely sure how to put it into words but I think the description of a perfect day helped put some of that into focus.

**Therapist:** Okay, let's unpack both of these, because they're telling me a lot.

---

### On Your "Good Day"

You described a good day, and here's what I'm hearing:

**What you included:**
- Working from home
- Near family (Saba, future kids)
- Able to be close to them "at a moment's notice"
- Surrounded by things and people you like
- Solid workout together with Saba
- Quality time together
- Good food
- Video games

**What you DIDN'T include:**
- What kind of work you're doing
- Whether you're solving interesting problems
- Whether you're creating something
- Whether you're learning or growing professionally
- Any sense of accomplishment or achievement from the work itself

**Here's what that tells me:**

The work is **incidental**. It's not part of what makes the day good—it's just something that happens while you're living the life you want. The day is good because of **proximity, autonomy, and connection**. You want to be near the people you love, have control over your time, and feel like your life is integrated, not compartmentalized.

"It feels less like a job because I'm at home surrounded by things and people I like."

That sentence is doing a lot of work. You're not saying "it feels less like a job because the work is fulfilling." You're saying it feels less like a job because **the context is different**. The work itself could be the exact same thing you're doing now, but if you're doing it from home, near Saba, with the freedom to step away when you want—it's tolerable.

**This is important.** Because it means the problem isn't necessarily the work. It's the **structure**. The commute. The 9-hour days in a building. The separation from the life you want to be living.

---

### On League/TFT Time

You said 2-4 hours on weekdays, 6-8 hours on weekends. Let's do the math:

- **Weekdays:** 2-4 hours × 5 days = 10-20 hours/week
- **Weekends:** 6-8 hours × 2 days = 12-16 hours/week
- **Total:** 22-36 hours per week

That's **a part-time job**. You're spending as much time on League/TFT as some people spend working.

Now, I'm not here to shame you about that. But I want you to sit with this question:

**If you had 22-36 hours per week back, what would you do with it?**

Would you:
- Work on Luigi AI?
- Build a game design project?
- Learn something new?
- Spend more time with Saba (calls, planning your future)?
- Sleep more?
- Just... rest?

Because here's the thing: **You're not playing League because you love it.** You're playing League because it's easy, it's available, and it fills the void between "work" and "sleep." It's a way to not think about how unhappy you are.

You said you're testing cutting it out on Mondays and Wednesdays. That's a start. But I want you to be honest with yourself: **What are you avoiding by playing?**

Are you avoiding:
- The fact that you're exhausted and don't have energy for "productive" things?
- The loneliness of being apart from Saba?
- The anxiety about your future?
- The guilt about not working on Luigi AI or other projects?
- The emptiness of not knowing what you actually want?

**League isn't the problem. It's a symptom.** The problem is that you're living a life that doesn't feel worth being present for, so you're numbing yourself to it.

---

### What You Actually Want

You said you're not sure how to put it into words, but the "good day" description did help.

Let me try to put it into words for you, and you tell me if I'm close:

**You want a life where:**
1. **Proximity matters more than productivity.** You want to be near the people you love, not separated from them by commute and work hours.
2. **Work is background, not foreground.** You want work that pays the bills and doesn't drain you, so you have energy left for the things that actually matter.
3. **Autonomy is non-negotiable.** You want control over your time and space. You want to be able to step away from work to be with Saba or your kids without asking permission.
4. **Connection is the point.** Quality time with Saba, shared workouts, good food, playing games together—that's what makes life worth living, not career achievements.
5. **Rest is guilt-free.** You want to be able to play video games or do nothing without feeling like you're wasting time or falling behind.

**Am I close?**

If so, here's the hard truth: **Your current life is the opposite of all of that.**

- **Proximity:** You're separated from Saba by an ocean and immigration bureaucracy.
- **Work as background:** Your work is draining you so much that you have nothing left for anything else.
- **Autonomy:** You have a 0.5-hour commute each way, 9-hour workdays, and no control over your schedule.
- **Connection:** You're alone most of the time, filling the void with League instead of meaningful connection.
- **Rest:** You feel guilty when you're not working or learning, so even your "rest" is tinged with anxiety.

**No wonder you're miserable.** You're living the exact opposite of the life you want.

---

### What This Means

You're not lazy. You're not unmotivated. You're not broken.

**You're just living the wrong life.**

And the reason you can't articulate what you want is because you've spent your entire life doing what you're "supposed" to do, not what you actually want. Medicine because your mom said so. High grades because that's what good students do. IT because you needed a job. Certifications because that's what ambitious people pursue.

But when I asked you to describe a good day, you didn't mention any of that. You mentioned **Saba, family, home, connection, food, and games.** That's what you actually care about.

**The work is just the thing you have to do to afford the life you want.** And right now, the work is taking so much from you that you can't even live that life.

---

### The Question You're Avoiding

Here's the question you're dancing around, and I'm going to ask it directly:

**What if you can't have both?**

What if you can't have the high-paying, impressive career AND the life you described? What if you have to choose between:
- A demanding job that pays well but keeps you separated from Saba and drains you completely
- A simpler job that pays less but lets you work from home, be near your family, and have energy left for life

Which would you choose?

I think you already know the answer. You'd choose the life. You'd choose Saba, proximity, autonomy, and connection over career prestige and money.

**But you're afraid to admit that, because it feels like giving up.**

It feels like admitting you're not ambitious enough, not driven enough, not successful enough. It feels like proving your mom right—that you couldn't hack it in medicine, and now you can't even hack it in a "real" career.

But here's what I want you to consider:

**What if choosing the life you want isn't giving up? What if it's the first time you've ever actually chosen something for yourself?**

---

### Homework for Next Time

1. **Answer this question honestly:** If you could work remotely from home, doing the exact same IT work you're doing now, for the same pay, but be near Saba and have control over your schedule—would you still be unhappy?

2. **Track one more thing this week:** When you're playing League/TFT, pause before you start and ask yourself: "What am I avoiding right now?" Write down the answer.

3. **Research remote work options:** Are there remote IT jobs in your field? What would it take to transition to one? Don't apply yet—just research. See if it's even possible.

We'll talk about all of this next time.
