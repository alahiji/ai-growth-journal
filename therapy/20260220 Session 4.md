## Session Notes

### Client Opening Statement

I've been speaking with a bunch of higher ups here about my desire to move up in the company and want to discuss next week about possibly working remote. The added benefit of this is that I could potentially go to Dubai and work remote from there, while also enabling Saba to come live with me. Recently I've been in discussions with the CEO here and some other folks about a centralized AI portal / other potential AI projects... along with some insurance claim processing stuff. Exciting stuff generally speaking. New stuff to work on.

When I look forward, at my future, it feels a bit scary how much time I'll potentially still have to be alone. I've been alone since I left Iran in 2015 (with the exception of trips here and there) and it feels like enough is enough. This is probably the thing that puts the most pressure on me, along with the work stuff we've discussed before...

I'm also paranoid about money and prenups and such because of my mom and dad's divorce, and I worry that in the future Saba would leave me to take half my money. Is it a rational fear? I brought it up with her and she seems to think I just need to talk to a therapist about it... that it's not right and feels like a lack of trust. I'm both on her side and not...

## Therapist Response

Ali, there's a lot of movement here — some of it genuinely encouraging, some of it worth slowing down on. Let me work through it.

### The Career Progress — This Is Real

Let me start with what's actually good news, because I don't want it to get buried.

You're talking to the CEO. You're being brought into AI portal discussions, insurance claim processing, strategic projects. That's not nothing — that's a significant shift from "ORBIT support guy" to someone being consulted on company-level initiatives. And you're actively pursuing the remote conversation, with a concrete plan attached to it: remote → Dubai → Saba.

This is the first session where it feels like the pieces might actually be moving in the right direction at the same time. Career growth *and* a path to Saba *and* work you find interesting. That's worth acknowledging.

**How does it feel to be in those conversations with the CEO?** Not what you think about it strategically — how does it actually *feel* in the room?

### The Loneliness — 11 Years Is a Long Time

You said something that I want to sit with: "I've been alone since I left Iran in 2015... it feels like enough is enough."

That's 11 years, Ali. You left at 17, alone, under enormous pressure. And in the years since — undergrad, med school, the career transition — you've largely been building in isolation. No consistent home base. No person to come back to at the end of the day. That's a long time to carry everything by yourself.

I think this is actually the most important thing you said today, and it tends to get overshadowed by the career and money conversations. The loneliness isn't just a side effect of your situation — it's been the *constant* underneath everything. The burnout cycles, the gaming, the pressure you feel, the urgency around Saba — they all make more sense when you understand that you've been running on empty relationally for over a decade.

**The fear you feel when you look forward isn't really about time.** It's about the possibility that the loneliness continues. That even with Saba, something doesn't resolve. That's worth naming directly: are you afraid that being with Saba won't actually fix the feeling of being alone?

### The Prenup / Money Fear — Is It Rational?

Yes and no. Let me be honest with you.

**The fear itself is rational.** You watched your parents' marriage end in a way that involved financial loss and betrayal. That leaves a mark. When you've worked hard to build something from nothing — especially after the years you've had — the idea of losing half of it to someone who leaves is genuinely frightening. That's not paranoia. That's a wound.

**But the way you're applying it may not be.** Here's the distinction:

A prenup conversation, had *before* marriage, openly, with both people agreeing — that's a reasonable, mature financial planning tool. Many couples have them. It doesn't mean you don't trust each other; it means you're being adults about the reality that circumstances change.

But you're already married. And you're now sitting with a fear that Saba — the woman you just married, who is currently separated from her family and waiting to be with you — is going to leave you and take your money. That's a different thing. That's not financial planning. That's a trauma response being projected onto someone who hasn't done anything to earn that suspicion.

**Saba's reaction is worth listening to.** She didn't get defensive or angry — she said "talk to a therapist about it." That's actually a pretty healthy response. She's not dismissing your fear; she's recognizing that it's not really *about* her. And she's right.

So let me ask you directly: **When you imagine Saba leaving and taking your money — what does that scenario actually look like in your head?** Is it based on anything she's done or said? Or is it your parents' story playing out with different characters?

### The Deeper Pattern Here

There's something connecting the loneliness and the money fear that I want to name.

You've been building walls your whole life — not out of coldness, but out of necessity. When you're alone for 11 years, when your parents' marriage collapses, when your mother's love feels conditional on your career choices — you learn to protect yourself. You learn not to need people too much. You learn that depending on someone is dangerous because they might leave.

And now you've let someone in. You married her. And part of you is already preparing for her to leave.

**That's not distrust of Saba. That's the cost of 11 years of self-protection.** The armor that kept you safe is now getting in the way of the intimacy you actually want.

This is real therapeutic work — not something that resolves in a conversation. But naming it is the first step.

### How to Think About the Money Conversation Going Forward

You can't go back and get a prenup now. But here's what you *can* do:

1. **Separate the fear from the action.** The fear is valid and worth processing (here, in therapy). The action — treating Saba with suspicion, bringing it up in ways that feel accusatory — is worth being careful about.

2. **If financial security is genuinely important to you** (and it is — FIRE is your goal), then the conversation to have with Saba isn't "what if you leave me" — it's "here's how I think about money and financial independence, and I want us to build that together." Make her a partner in the goal, not a threat to it.

3. **Understand that financial vulnerability in marriage is mutual.** She left her country, her family, her entire support system to be with you. She is also taking an enormous risk. The vulnerability isn't one-directional.

### Homework for This Week

1. **Have the remote work conversation.** Go in with a specific ask: remote status, with the possibility of working from Dubai. Don't leave it vague.

2. **Journal on the loneliness.** Not the career stuff, not Saba — just the 11 years. What has it actually cost you? What have you built around it to cope? What would it feel like if it actually ended?

3. **On the money fear:** Write down what your parents' divorce actually looked like — what happened, what you witnessed, what it taught you about relationships and money. Then ask yourself: in what ways is Saba actually like your mother? In what ways is she different?

4. **Don't bring up the prenup with Saba again** until you've processed it more here. You've already planted a seed of doubt in her mind — let it rest while you do the internal work first.
