# Therapy Folder Guide

## How to Use This Folder

### Starting a Session
1. Open the current session file (or create a new one)
2. Add your thoughts under `## Continue Session Below`
3. Share the file with me and I'll respond as your therapist

### File Naming Convention
```
YYYYMMDD Session N.md
```
Example: `20251222 Session 1.md`

## File Size Guidelines

**When to start a new session file:**
- **Recommended:** ~50-100 exchanges (You + Therapist responses)
- **Technical limit:** Keep files under ~50KB (~15,000 words) for best performance
- **Practical limit:** When scrolling becomes cumbersome or themes shift significantly

**Signs it's time for a new file:**
- Session naturally concludes a topic
- You want a "fresh start" on a new issue
- File feels unwieldy to navigate

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `_SESSION_INDEX.md` | **Critical** - Running summary, themes, goals. Update after significant sessions. |
| Session files | Actual conversations. Chronological record. |

---

## How I Stay in the Loop

When you start a new session, share:
1. **`_SESSION_INDEX.md`** - Always (gives me context)
2. **Current session file** - For the conversation
3. **Previous session** - Optional, if directly relevant

The underscore prefix (`_`) keeps index files sorted to the top.

## Tips for Effective Sessions

- **Be honest** - This is a safe space
- **Write freely** - Grammar/structure don't matter
- **Update the index** - After major breakthroughs or new goals
- **Date your entries** - Helps track progress over time
