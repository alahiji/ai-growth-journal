# Consent to Serve as Registered Agent

## Luigi AI LLC — Domestic Limited Liability Company (Texas)

---

### Why This Document Exists

Texas Business Organizations Code §5.2011 requires that a person or entity designated as a registered agent must **consent** to serve in that capacity. When you file the Certificate of Formation (Form 205) on SOSDirect, you are representing that the registered agent has consented. This document serves as your written proof of that consent.

Since **you are appointing yourself** as the registered agent, you sign this form yourself. Keep it with your LLC records.

## CONSENT OF REGISTERED AGENT

I, the undersigned, hereby consent to serve as the **Registered Agent** in the State of Texas for:

**Luigi AI LLC**

a Domestic Limited Liability Company to be formed under the laws of the State of Texas.
