## After Filing — Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Obtain an EIN (Free, Same Day)
- Go to [IRS EIN Online Application](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online)
- Apply as a **Single-Member LLC**
- You'll receive your EIN immediately upon completion
- **You need this before opening a bank account**

### 2. Open a Business Bank Account
- Bring your **stamped Certificate of Formation** and **EIN letter**
- Keep business and personal finances **completely separate**
- Recommended: Chase, Wells Fargo, or a local credit union with free business checking

### 3. File Your Operating Agreement
- Not filed with the state, but **legally important**
- See `04-Operating-Agreement.md` for a template
- Even as a single-member LLC, this protects your limited liability

### 4. Get a Business Address (Optional)
- If you don't want your home address public, consider a **registered agent service** or **virtual office**
- Your registered agent address is **public record**

### 5. Texas Franchise Tax
- Texas has **no state income tax** but has a **franchise tax**
- LLCs with revenue under **$2.47 million** owe **$0** in franchise tax
- You still must file a **No Tax Due Report** annually
- First report due **May 15** of the year after formation
- File at [Texas Comptroller WebFile](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/franchise/)

### 6. City/County Business Permits
- Check if your city requires a **business license** or **home occupation permit**
- This varies by municipality
