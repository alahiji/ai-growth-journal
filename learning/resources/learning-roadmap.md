# AI Learning Roadmap

## 🔄 Current Context (February 2026)

**Status**: Paused for life transition planning

**Current Priorities**:
1. ✅ Azure AI-102 certification (Completed 12/28/2025)
2. Apply Azure AI skills in practical healthcare IT projects
3. Maintain current skill level while managing major life decisions
4. Defer deep learning and advanced topics until personal situation stabilizes
5. Focus on job market research for potential relocation

**Timeline Adjustment**: 
- Original roadmap assumed continuous focused learning
- Now adjusted for: marriage, potential international relocation, work-life balance focus
- Emphasis on **sustainable learning** over aggressive timeline

**Key Decision Points**:
- If relocating to GCC: Research AI/ML job market and adjust skills accordingly
- If staying in US: Continue healthcare AI specialization path
- Prioritize portable, internationally-recognized skills
