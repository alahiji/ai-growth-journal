## Challenges & Solutions

### Biggest Challenge
Ex

### How You Overcame It
Watched multiple YouTube videos, implemented a simple network from scratch in NumPy, and drew out the mathematical computations step by step.

### Lessons Learned
Visual learning works best for me. Need to implement concepts from scratch to truly understand them, not just use high-level APIs.

## Personal Growth Notes
Really enjoying the hands-on aspect of AI/ML. The combination of math, programming, and real-world applications is exactly what I was looking for. Need to be more consistent with daily practice - some days I get distracted by other things. Planning to set aside 2 hours every morning for focused learning.

The community aspect is also important - joined the Fast.ai forum and local ML meetup group. Getting different perspectives helps a lot.
