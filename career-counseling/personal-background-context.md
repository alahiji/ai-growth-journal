- Unique niche: Healthcare IT + AI/Automation
- **Critical concern**: Repeating burnout pattern (third cycle)

### Immediate Career Counseling Focus

#### 1. **Remote Work Research (PRIORITY)**

**Action Items**:
- Research remote IT positions in healthcare AI/automation

**Trade-offs to Evaluate**:
- Career advancement vs. proximity to spouse
- Potentially "duller" work vs. being with family
- Building portable skills vs. location-specific expertise

#### 3. **Pace Management (CRITICAL)**
**Standard advice would be harmful** - client needs permission to do LESS

**Specific Interventions**:
- Reduce simultaneous goals from 12+ to 2-3 maximum
- Sequence certifications (don't parallel)

- Defer: Video game project, Linux learning until life stabilizes

### Burnout Prevention Strategies (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Weekly Monitoring**:

**Red Flags for Immediate Intervention**:

### Skill Development Priorities

## Key Career Counseling Principles for This Client

1. **Pace over speed**: Sustainable growth beats sprints
2. **Depth over breadth**: Master 2-3 areas vs. surface-level many
3. **Internal over external**: Genuine interest vs. "should" do
4. **Life over career**: Proximity/autonomy/connection > prestige
5. **Prevention over recovery**: Stop burnout cycle before it completes

---

**For Career Counselors**: This client needs permission to prioritize life over career advancement. Standard "ambitious goals" advice will trigger burnout cycle. Focus on sustainable, integrated approach where work supports life, not dominates it.
