Good afternoon Julia, hope you are well. I saw that you're also a Baylor alum and work at a company I'm interested in applying to- Deriv. 



Thank you for your time, I really appreciate it. The job search process can be pretty grueling 😅



I recently got married and it's going to be a while before I can bring my spouse to the US, and am thus looking for jobs in Dubai/surrounding areas.



If you can please help me, or connect me with people at the company who can potentially help me, I'm applying for the "Staff Applied AI Engineer" position. I've attached my CV here as well.



Thanks again for your time.
