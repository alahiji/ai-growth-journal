Career Change
At the onset of my 3rd year of medical school, the first clinical year, I finalized my decision to pursue IT, which has been my passion since childhood. 

I am a very quick learner and take pride in my work. I am organized, punctual, and patient. After a rigorous academic career and being accepted into medical school, the transition to IT has been easy: I believe my analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and passion for technology set me apart.
