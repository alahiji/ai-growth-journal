## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I get AWS or Google Cloud first?

**AWS** - Here's why:
1. Larger market share (60% vs 10%)
2. More job postings require AWS
3. Cheaper exam ($150 vs $200)
4. You already have Azure (AWS complements better)
5. Texas/Atlanta markets are AWS-heavy

Get GCP second to become "multi-cloud" (premium positioning).

### Do I need a degree in CS/Math for these certs?

**No** - Your background is actually advantageous:
- Biology degree shows analytical thinking
- Med school shows you can handle complex material
- Azure AI-102 proves you can learn ML
- Production projects (ORBIT, MISSION CONTROL) prove hands-on skills

Certifications + portfolio > degree for ML Engineer roles.

### Can I get these jobs with just certifications?

**Yes, but...**
- Certifications open doors (get interviews)
- **Projects close deals** (get offers)
- Combination is powerful

**Your advantage**: You have production experience (18+ projects). Add certifications = very competitive.

### Should I quit DHR to study full-time?

**NO** - Here's why:
1. You can study 10-15 hrs/week while working
2. DHR gives you production ML experience (valuable)
3. You can negotiate raise with new certs
4. Financial stability while job hunting
5. "Currently employed" = stronger negotiating position

**Better approach**: Get AWS cert → negotiate raise OR start interviewing → leave when you have better offer.

### What about Saba and relocation?

**Good news**: These certifications are **internationally recognized**
- GCC countries value AWS/Azure/GCP
- Remote US jobs let you work from anywhere
- Multi-cloud skills = global marketability

**Strategy**: Get certs → find remote US job ($150k+) → work from Oman if needed → bring Saba to US later

---

## Final Recommendation

### Your Optimal Path

1. **Next 4 months**: AWS ML Engineer - Associate
   - Study 10-15 hrs/week

   - Location: Remote preferred (flexibility for Saba)

3. **Month 7-11**: Google Cloud ML Engineer
   - Now you're multi-cloud
   - Target: $135k-$165k roles

4. **Month 12+**: Specialization (LLM, MLOps, or Healthcare AI)
   - Target: $165k-$195k Senior roles

### Expected Outcome (12-18 months)

- **Salary**: $135k-$165k (vs current ~$75k-85k)
- **Title**: ML Engineer or Senior AI Engineer
- **Location**: Remote (flexibility for Saba)
- **Skills**: Multi-cloud, production ML, deep learning
