## Usage Guidelines

### Daily Learning
- Add new concepts to `learning/YYYY/concepts/`
- Document experiments in `projects/YYYY/experiments/`
- Track progress in `reflections/YYYY/`

### Project Organization
- Use descriptive folder names with dates
- Include README.md in each project folder
- Tag projects by difficulty and topic

### File Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `machine-learning-basics.md`
- Include dates for time-sensitive content: `2025-01-15-transformer-paper.md`
- Use consistent prefixes for similar content types

## Getting Started

1. Create your first learning entry in `learning/2025/concepts/`
2. Start a project in `projects/2025/experiments/`
3. Document your progress in `reflections/2025/`

## Templates

See the `templates/` directory for:
