# Shared Context for Therapist & Career Counselor

> **Purpose**: This document provides comprehensive background context for both therapy and career counseling. It consolidates biographical information, patterns, and current situation to ensure continuity across all professional support.

**Last Updated**: February 3, 2026  
**Age**: 28 years old  
**Started Therapy**: December 22, 2025

---

## Quick Reference

### Current Primary Concerns
1. **Work-life balance**: Long commute, 9-hour days, exhaustion
2. **Career fulfillment**: Questioning if IT provides enough creativity/challenge
3. **Relationship**: Long-distance marriage, fear of expecting spouse to "fix" unhappiness
4. **Relocation decision**: GCC country (Oman) vs. US immigration (3-6 month timeline)
5. **Burnout risk**: Third cycle emerging (after undergrad and med school)
6. **Work philosophy**: Honest admission - would retire if possible; seeking autonomy, creativity, meaning

### Critical Patterns to Monitor
- **Burnout cycle**: High achievement → burnout → failure (happened twice before)
- **External validation seeking**: Pursuing what "should" do vs. what wants to do
- **"Making up for lost time"**: Overcommitting to prove worth
- **Sleep debt**: 7 hours/night (needs 7.5-8), weekend oversleeping

## Current Life Situation (February 2026)

### Major Life Changes
- **Marriage**: Married Saba in Iran on January 17, 2026 during month-long trip (late December 2025 - late January 2026)
- **Relationship Status**: Long-distance marriage (temporary)
- **Critical Decision Point**: Evaluating relocation to GCC country (Oman) vs. US immigration process

### Relocation Considerations

**Option 1: Move to GCC Country (Oman)**
- **Pros**: Faster timeline to be with Saba (~6 months target), closer to her family
- **Cons**: Potentially less AI opportunity, may require more "dull work", career advancement uncertainty
- **Saba's Position**: Willing to go anywhere, dislikes very rainy countries (UK ruled out)
- **Primary Motivation**: Being with Saba (running toward her, not away from current situation)

**Option 2: Bring Saba to US**
- **Pros**: Maintain current career trajectory, familiar environment
- **Cons**: Lengthy immigration process, current administration challenges
- **Status**: Difficult but preferred if possible

### Current Daily Reality
- **Work**: Associate AI Automation Engineer at DHR (hospital IT)
- **Commute**: 0.5 hour each way (1 hour total daily)
- **Work hours**: 9 hours (including unpaid lunch)
- **Exercise**: Trying to maintain 30min daily, 3 heavy gym days
- **Sleep**: 7 hours/night (11pm-6am), oversleeps on weekends
- **Gaming**: League/TFT 22-36 hours/week (2-4 hrs weekdays, 6-8 hrs weekends)

### What a "Good Day" Looks Like (Client's Words)
> "Working from home, near my family, able to be close to Saba or my kids at a moment's notice. It feels less like a job because I'm at home surrounded by things and people I like. I get a solid workout in together with Saba, and we spend quality time together. Eat good food. That's a damn good day. Maybe throw some video games in there too."

**Key Insight**: Work is incidental. What matters is proximity, autonomy, and connection. The problem isn't necessarily the work—it's the structure (commute, office, separation from life).

## Psychological Patterns & Insights

### Documented Burnout Cycle (3x)
1. **Undergrad**: 3.96 GPA → Burnout → Semester of Fs
2. **Med School**: Top 1% MCAT → Medical School → Burnout → Failed out
3. **Current**: Top 20% of 1-year devs → Warning signs emerging

**Pattern**: High achievement in fields not aligned with genuine interests, driven by external validation, leading to burnout.

### "Making Up for Lost Time" Syndrome
- 12+ simultaneous goals
- 6 projects in 3 months
- Side business while working full-time
- Multiple certifications in parallel
- Feeling guilty when not working/learning

**Risk**: This is the SAME pattern that led to previous burnouts.

### External vs. Internal Motivation

**Past Pattern**:
- Pursued medicine for "safety and guarantee" (mother's ultimatum)
- Trying to be a "good kid"
- Seeking external validation (MENSA test)

**Current Pattern**:
- Genuine enjoyment of technical work ("hella fun")
- Self-directed learning
- Entrepreneurial initiative (Luigi AI)
- **BUT**: Pace suggests still proving something, not just enjoying

### Key Insights from Therapy

1. **Work Philosophy**: If could do anything, would retire and not work
   - Interested in FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)
   - Regrets not completing medicine for faster retirement path
   - Enjoys music, games, movies, "doing nothing"
   - Doesn't feel the "need to work" that many people describe

2. **Reframe**: "Not wanting to work" may actually be "not wanting to do things I hate just to survive"

3. **Pattern Recognition**: Never actually chosen work wanted to do—only work thought should do

4. **What Actually Seeking**: Autonomy, creativity, and meaning—not necessarily "no work"

5. **Relationship Expectations**: May be expecting too much from Saba to "fix" unhappiness
   - Current job won't become tolerable just because Saba is present
   - Need to identify what actually needs to change for sustainable happiness

6. **Core Fears**:
   - Love won't be enough to make life worth living
   - Saba will be disappointed in her life with him
   - Guilt about her sacrifices (family, environment she knows)

### The "CS Building Moment"
During darkest period (undergraduate burnout), sought out CS building and watched students design Frogger. Felt "exceptionally envious and sad."

**This was authentic self trying to surface.** That moment of envy was internal compass pointing toward genuine interest.

### Gaming as Symptom
- League/TFT: 22-36 hours/week (part-time job equivalent)
- Not playing because loves it—playing because it's easy, available, fills void
- Way to not think about unhappiness
- **League isn't the problem, it's a symptom**: Living a life that doesn't feel worth being present for

## Areas Requiring Special Attention

### 1. Burnout Prevention (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Why This Matters More**:
- Documented pattern of high achievement → burnout → failure
- Showing early warning signs again
- Stakes are higher: finally in field he enjoys
- Major life transitions (marriage, relocation) add stress

**Current Warning Signs**:
- Persistent fatigue despite adequate sleep
- Feeling guilty when not working/learning
- 22-36 hours/week gaming (avoidance)
- "Wishing for more time to focus on projects and less time on work"
- Procrastination after work (mental fatigue, not laziness)

**Specific Interventions**:
1. Recognize the pattern—repeating the cycle
2. Reframe "lost time"—those years taught what DON'T want
3. Set sustainable pace—have 30-40 years of career ahead
4. Monitor burnout indicators weekly
5. Permission to do LESS, not encouragement to do MORE

### 2. External Validation Patterns

**Historical Indicators**:
- Pursuing medicine for "safety and guarantee"
- MENSA test to "prove worth"
- Trying to be a "good kid"

**Current Risk**:
- Are certifications valuable, or to prove something?
- Is Luigi AI genuine business interest, or proving can do it?
- Are 12+ goals about growth, or about not being "behind"?

**Healthy Approach**:
- Pursue goals aligned with genuine interests and career strategy
- Measure success by internal satisfaction, not external metrics
- Already proven capability (multiple times)

### 3. Sleep Management

**Current**: 7 hours/night (11pm-6am), oversleeps on weekends

**Problem**: Sleep debt doesn't work like bank account. Can't run deficit all week and make up on Saturday.

**What Happens**:
- **Weekdays**: Running on fumes, decision-making suffers, stress tolerance drops, emotional regulation weakens
- **Weekends**: Sleep 10+ hours trying to recover, throws off circadian rhythm, makes Monday harder

**Need**: 7.5-8 hours consistently, every night. In bed by 10pm if waking at 6am.

### 4. Work Structure vs. Content

**Key Insight**: Problem may not be the work itself, but the structure:
- Commute (1 hour total daily)
- 9-hour days in office
- Separation from life/people he loves
- Lack of autonomy

**Evidence**: "Good day" description focused on working from home, near family, with autonomy—not on different work.

## Therapy Session Log

| Session | Date | Focus | Key Themes | Status |
|---------|------|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | 2025-12-22 | Initial intake | Work relationship, school→work transition, 12hr daily commitment, existential dread | Complete |
| 2 | 2026-01-28 | Sleep, marriage, career | Sleep deprivation, relationship expectations, marriage revelation, GCC move consideration | In Progress |

### Running Therapy Themes
- **Work relationship**: Feels unprepared; school success didn't translate to work skills
- **Time burden**: 10hr total (work + commute + lunch)
- **Emotional state**: Exhausted; occasional thoughts of self-harm (passive, no intent to act)
- **Coping attempts**: Self-help books (not working)
- **Core fear**: The *effort*—fear of having to push this hard indefinitely
- **Pattern**: Working in hospital = daily reminder of path not taken
- **Original dream**: Graphic designer (first genuine spark in conversation)
- **Structure vs content**: Commute + long hours may be as unbearable as the work itself
- **Worldview**: Currently dark—"not worth having kids" = symptom of pain, not philosophy
- **Values**: Doesn't need altruism to feel fulfilled; donates money as contribution

### Current Therapy Homework
1. **Answer honestly**: If could work remotely from home, doing exact same IT work for same pay, but near Saba with control over schedule—would still be unhappy?
2. **Track**: When playing League/TFT, pause before starting and ask: "What am I avoiding right now?" Write down answer.
3. **Research**: Remote work options in IT field. Don't apply yet—just research if possible.

5. **RESET**: Before resuming, reduce goals by 50%
6. **MONITOR**: Daily check-ins for 2 weeks

---

## Key Reframes & Insights

### The "Lost Time" Narrative

**Old Story**: "I wasted 8+ years pursuing medicine. Now I'm behind and need to catch up."

**New Story**: "I spent 8 years learning crucial lessons:
- What I don't want (medicine, external validation)
- What I do want (technology, creative problem-solving)
- How I work best (project-based, self-directed)
- What leads to burnout (unsustainable pace, external motivation)
- What genuine interest feels like ('hella fun')

I'm not behind. I'm exactly where I need to be, with wisdom most 1-year developers don't have."

### What You're Actually Seeking

Not "no work" but:
1. **Proximity over productivity** - Near people you love
2. **Work as background, not foreground** - Pays bills, doesn't drain
3. **Autonomy** - Control over time and space
4. **Connection** - Quality time with Saba, family
5. **Guilt-free rest** - Play games, do nothing without anxiety

### The Core Question

**What if you can't have both?**
- High-paying, impressive career that drains you
- vs. Simpler job that lets you work from home, be near family, have energy for life

**You'd choose the life.** But afraid to admit it because feels like giving up.

**Reframe**: What if choosing the life you want isn't giving up? What if it's the first time you've ever actually chosen something for yourself?

## Notes for Professionals

### For Therapist
- Client has documented pattern of high achievement followed by burnout
- Currently in early stages of repeating pattern in field he genuinely enjoys
- Priority: Pace management and burnout prevention
- Avoid standard "push yourself" advice—needs permission to do LESS
- Major life transitions (marriage, relocation) add complexity
- Gaming (22-36 hrs/week) is avoidance symptom, not root problem

### For Career Counselor
- Top 20% performer but unsustainable pace
- Unique skillset: healthcare + AI/automation
- May need help reframing "success" from external metrics to internal satisfaction
- Remote work research may be more valuable than new certifications
- GCC relocation complicates career planning—need portable skills
- Luigi AI needs clear decision: revenue-generating business or portfolio project

### Shared Priorities
1. **Burnout prevention** (highest priority)
2. **Sustainable pacing** (quality over quantity)
3. **Internal vs. external motivation** (choosing vs. "should")
4. **Work-life integration** (not just balance)
5. **Relocation decision support** (3-6 month timeline)
